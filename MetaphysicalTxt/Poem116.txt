i walkd the other day to spend my hour into a field where i sometimes had seen the soil to yield a gallant flowr but winter now had ruffled all the bowr and curious store i knew there heretofore  yet i whose search lovd not to peep and peer i th face of things thought with my self there might be other springs besides this here which like cold friends sees us but once a year and so the flowr might have some other bowr  then taking up what i could nearest spy i diggd about that place where i had seen him to grow out and by and by i saw the warm recluse alone to lie where fresh and green he livd of us unseen  many a question intricate and rare did i there strow but all i could extort was that he now did there repair such losses as befell him in this air and would ere long come forth most fair and young  this past i threw the clothes quite oer his head and stung with fear of my own frailty droppd down many a tear upon his bed then sighing whisperd happy are the dead what peace doth now rock him asleep below  and yet how few believe such doctrine springs from a poor root which all the winter sleeps here under foot and hath no wings to raise it to the truth and light of things but is still trod by evry wandring clod  o thou whose spirit did at first inflame and warm the dead and by a sacred incubation fed with life this frame which once had neither being form nor name grant i may so thy steps track here below  that in these masques and shadows i may see thy sacred way and by those hid ascents climb to that day which breaks from thee who art in all things though invisibly shew me thy peace thy mercy love and ease  and from this care where dreams and sorrows reign lead me above where light joy leisure and true comforts move without all pain there hid in thee shew me his life again at whose dumb urn thus all the year i mourn
