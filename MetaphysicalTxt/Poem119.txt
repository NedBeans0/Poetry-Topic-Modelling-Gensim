my soul there is a country afar beyond the stars where stands a winged sentry all skillful in the wars there above noise and danger sweet peace sits crownd with smiles and one born in a manger commands the beauteous files he is thy gracious friend and o my soul awake did in pure love descend to die here for thy sake if thou canst get but thither there grows the flowr of peace the rose that cannot wither thy fortress and thy ease leave then thy foolish ranges for none can thee secure but one who never changes thy god thy life thy cure
