i made a posy while the day ran by here will i smell my remnant out and tie my life within this band but time did beckon to the flowers and they by noon most cunningly did steal away and withered in my hand  my hand was next to them and then my heart i took without more thinking in good part times gentle admonition who did so sweetly deaths sad taste convey making my mind to smell my fatal day yet sugring the suspicion  farewell dear flowers sweetly your time ye spent fit while ye lived for smell or ornament and after death for cures i follow straight without complaints or grief since if my scent be good i care not if it be as short as yours
