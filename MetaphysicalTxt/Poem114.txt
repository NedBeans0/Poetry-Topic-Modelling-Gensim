awake glad heart get up and sing it is the birthday of thy king awake awake the sun doth shake light from his locks and all the way breathing perfumes doth spice the day  awake awake hark how th wood rings winds whisper and the busy springs a concert make awake awake man is their highpriest and should rise to offer up the sacrifice  i would i were some bird or star fluttring in woods or lifted far above this inn and road of sin then either star or bird should be shining or singing still to thee  i would i had in my best part fit rooms for thee or that my heart were so clean as thy manger was but i am all filth and obscene yet if thou wilt thou canst make clean  sweet jesu will then let no more this leper haunt and soil thy door cure him ease him o release him and let once more by mystic birth the lord of life be born in earth
