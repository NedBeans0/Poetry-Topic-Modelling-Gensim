love thou are absolute sole lord of life and death to prove the word well now appeal to none of all those thy old soldiers great and tall ripe men of martyrdom that could reach down with strong arms their triumphant crown such as could with lusty breath speak loud into the face of death their great lords glorious name to none of those whose spacious bosoms spread a throne for love at large to fill spare blood and sweat and see him take a private seat making his mansion in the mild and milky soul of a soft child  scarce has she learnd to lisp the name of martyr yet she thinks it shame life should so long play with that breath which spent can buy so brave a death she never undertook to know what death with love should have to do nor has she eer yet understood why to show love she should shed blood yet though she cannot tell you why she can love and she can die  scarce has she blood enough to make a guilty sword blush for her sake yet has shea heart dares hope to prove how much less strong is death than love  be love but there let poor six years be posd with the maturest fears man trembles at you straight shall find love knows no nonage nor the mind tis love not years or limbs that can make the martyr or the man  love touchd her heart and lo it beats high and burns with such brave heats such thirsts to die as dares drink up a thousand cold deaths in one cup good reason for she breathes all fire her weak breast heaves with strong desire of what she may with fruitless wishes seek for amongst her mothers kisses  since tis not to be had at home shell travel to a martyrdom no home for hers confesses she but where she may a martyr be  shell to the moors and trade with them for this unvalued diadem shell offer them her dearest breath with christs name in t in change for death shell bargain with them and will give them god teach them how to live in him or if they this deny for him shell teach them how to die so shall she leave amongst them sown her lords blood or at least her own  farewell then all the world adieu teresa is no more for you farewell all pleasures sports and joys never till now esteemed toys farewell whatever dear may be mothers arms or fathers knee farewell house and farewell home shes for the moors and martyrdom  sweet not so fast lo thy fair spouse whom thou seekst with so swift vows calls thee back and bids thee come t embrace a milder martyrdom  blest powers forbid thy tender life should bleed upon a barbarous knife or some base hand have power to rase thy breasts chaste cabinet and uncase a soul kept there so sweet oh no wise heavn will never have it so thou art loves victim and must die a death more mystical and high into loves arms thou shalt let fall a stillsurviving funeral he is the dart must make the death whose stroke shall taste thy hallowd breath a dart thrice dippd in that rich flame which writes thy spouses radiant name upon the roof of heavn where aye it shines and with a sovereign ray beats bright upon the burning faces of souls which in that names sweet graces find everlasting smiles so rare so spiritual pure and fair must be th immortal instrument upon whose choice point shall be sent a life so lovd and that there be fit executioners for thee the fairst and firstborn sons of fire blest seraphim shall leave their quire and turn loves soldiers upon thee to exercise their archery  oh how oft shalt thou complain of a sweet and subtle pain of intolerable joys of a death in which who dies loves his death and dies again and would forever so be slain and lives and dies and knows not why to live but that he thus may never leave to die  how kindly will thy gentle heart kiss the sweetlykilling dart and close in his embraces keep those delicious wounds that weep balsam to heal themselves with thus when these thy deaths so numerous shall all at last die into one and melt thy souls sweet mansion like a soft lump of incense hasted by too hot a fire and wasted into perfuming clouds so fast shalt thou exhale to heavn at last in a resolving sigh and then o what ask not the tongues of men angels cannot tell suffice thyself shall feel thine own full joys and hold them fast forever there so soon as thou shalt first appear the moon of maiden stars thy white mistress attended by such bright souls as thy shining self shall come and in her first ranks make thee room where mongst her snowy family immortal welcomes wait for thee  o what delight when reveald life shall stand and teach thy lips heavn with his hand on which thou now mayst to thy wishes heap up thy consecrated kisses

look round about and see thousands of crownd souls throng to be themselves thy crown sons of thy vows the virginbirths with which thy sovereign spouse made fruitful thy fair soul go now and with them all about thee bow to him put on hell say put on my rosy love that thy rich zone sparkling with the sacred flames of thousand souls whose happy names heavn keeps upon thy score thy bright life brought them first to kiss the light that kindled them to stars and so thou with the lamb thy lord shalt go and wheresoeer he sets his white steps walk with him those ways of light which who in death would live to see must learn in life to die like thee
