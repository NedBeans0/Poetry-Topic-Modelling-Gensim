with what deep murmurs through times silent stealth doth thy transparent cool and watry wealth here flowing fall and chide and call as if his liquid loose retinue stayd lingring and were of this steep place afraid the common pass where clear as glass all must descend not to an end but quickend by this deep and rocky grave rise to a longer course more bright and brave  dear stream dear bank where often i have sate and pleasd my pensive eye why since each drop of thy quick store runs thither whence it flowd before should poor souls fear a shade or night who came sure from a sea of light or since those drops are all sent back so sure to thee that none doth lack why should frail flesh doubt any more that what god takes hell not restore  o useful element and clear my sacred wash and cleanser here my first consigner unto those fountains of life where the lamb goes what sublime truths and wholesome themes lodge in thy mystical deep streams such as dull man can never find unless that spirit lead his mind which first upon thy face did move and hatchd all with his quickning love as this loud brooks incessant fall in streaming rings restagnates all which reach by course the bank and then are no more seen just so pass men o my invisible estate my glorious liberty still late thou art the channel my soul seeks not this with cataracts and creeks
