i saw eternity the other night like a great ring of pure and endless light all calm as it was bright and round beneath it time in hours days years drivn by the spheres like a vast shadow movd in which the world and all her train were hurld the doting lover in his quaintest strain did there complain near him his lute his fancy and his flights wits sour delights with gloves and knots the silly snares of pleasure yet his dear treasure all scatterd lay while he his eyes did pour upon a flowr  the darksome statesman hung with weights and woe like a thick midnightfog movd there so slow he did not stay nor go condemning thoughts like sad eclipses scowl upon his soul and clouds of crying witnesses without pursued him with one shout yet diggd the mole and lest his ways be found workd under ground where he did clutch his prey but one did see that policy churches and altars fed him perjuries were gnats and flies it raind about him blood and tears but he drank them as free  the fearful miser on a heap of rust sate pining all his life there did scarce trust his own hands with the dust yet would not place one piece above but lives in fear of thieves thousands there were as frantic as himself and huggd each one his pelf the downright epicure placd heavn in sense and scornd pretence while others slippd into a wide excess said little less the weaker sort slight trivial wares enslave who think them brave and poor despised truth sate counting by their victory  yet some who all this while did weep and sing and sing and weep soard up into the ring but most would use no wing o fools said i thus to prefer dark night before true light to live in grots and caves and hate the day because it shews the way the way which from this dead and dark abode leads up to god a way where you might tread the sun and be more bright than he but as i did their madness so discuss one whisperd thus this ring the bridegroom did for none provide but for his bride
