a ward and still in bonds one day i stole abroad it was high spring and all the way primrosed and hung with shade yet was it frost within and surly winds blasted my infant buds and sin like clouds eclipsed my mind  stormed thus i straight perceived my spring mere stage and show my walk a monstrous mountained thing roughcast with rocks and snow and as a pilgrims eye far from relief measures the melancholy sky then drops and rains for grief  so sighed i upwards still at last twixt steps and falls i reached the pinnacle where placed i found a pair of scales i took them up and laid in th one late pains the other smoke and pleasures weighed but proved the heavier grains  with that some cried away straight i obeyed and led full east a fair fresh field could spy some called it jacobs bed a virgin soil which no rude feet ere trod where since he stepped there only go prophets and friends of god  here i reposed but scarce well set a grove descried of stately height whose branches met and mixed on every side i entered and once in amazed to see t found all was changed and a new spring did all my senses greet  the unthrift sun shot vital gold a thousand pieces and heaven its azure did unfold checkered with snowy fleeces the air was all in spice and every bush a garland wore thus fed my eyes but all the ear lay hush  only a little fountain lent some use for ears and on the dumb shades language spent the music of her tears i drew her near and found the cistern full of divers stones some bright and round others illshaped and dull  the first pray mark as quick as light danced through the flood but the last more heavy than the night nailed to the center stood i wondered much but tired at last with thought my restless eye that still desired as strange an object brought  it was a bank of flowers where i descried though twas midday some fast asleep others broadeyed and taking in the ray here musing long i heard a rushing wind which still increased but whence it stirred no where i could not find  i turned me round and to each shade dispatched an eye to see if any leaf had made least motion or reply but while i listening sought my mind to ease by knowing where twas or where not it whispered where i please  lord then said i on me one breath and let me die before my death   cant chap 5 ver 17  arise o north and come thou southwind and blow upon my garden that the spices thereof may flow out
