sweetest love i do not go for weariness of thee nor in hope the world can show a fitter love for me but since that i must die at last tis best to use myself in jest thus by feignd deaths to die  yesternight the sun went hence and yet is here today he hath no desire nor sense nor half so short a way then fear not me but believe that i shall make speedier journeys since i take more wings and spurs than he  o how feeble is mans power that if good fortune fall cannot add another hour nor a lost hour recall but come bad chance and we join toit our strength and we teach it art and length itself oer us toadvance  when thou sighst thou sighst not wind but sighst my soul away when thou weepst unkindly kind my lifes blood doth decay it cannot be that thou lovst me as thou sayst if in thine my life thou waste that art the best of me  let not thy divining heart forethink me any ill destiny may take thy part and may thy fears fulfil but think that we are but turnd aside to sleep they who one another keep alive neer parted be
