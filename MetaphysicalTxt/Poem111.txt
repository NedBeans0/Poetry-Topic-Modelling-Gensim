the fleet astronomer can bore and thread the spheres with his quickpiercing mind he views their stations walks from door to door surveys as if he had designed to make a purchase there he sees their dances and knoweth long before both their fulleyes aspècts and secret glances  the nimble diver with his side cuts through the working waves that he may fetch his dearlyearnèd pearl which god did hide on purpose from the venturous wretch that he might save his life and also hers who with excessive pride her own destruction and his danger wears  the subtle chymic can divest and strip the creature naked till he find the callow principles within their nest there he imparts to them his mind admitted to their bedchamber before they appear trim and dressed to ordinary suitors at the door  what hath not man sought out and found but his dear god who yet his glorious law embosoms in us mellowing the ground with showers and frosts with love and awe so that we need not say wheres this command poor man thou searchest round to find out death but missest life at hand
