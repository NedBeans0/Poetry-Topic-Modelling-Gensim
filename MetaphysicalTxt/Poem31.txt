when my grave is broke up again some second guest to entertain for graves have learnd that woman head to be to more than one a bed and he that digs it spies a bracelet of bright hair about the bone will he not letus alone and think that there a loving couple lies who thought that this device might be some way to make their souls at the last busy day meet at this grave and make a little stay  if this fall in a time or land where misdevotion doth command then he that digs us up will bring us to the bishop and the king to make us relics then thou shalt be a mary magdalen and i a something else thereby all women shall adore us and some men and since at such time miracles are sought i would have that age by this paper taught what miracles we harmless lovers wrought  first we lovd well and faithfully yet knew not what we lovd nor why difference of sex no more we knew than our guardian angels do coming and going we perchance might kiss but not between those meals our hands neer touchd the seals which nature injurd by late law sets free these miracles we did but now alas all measure and all language i should pass should i tell what a miracle she was
