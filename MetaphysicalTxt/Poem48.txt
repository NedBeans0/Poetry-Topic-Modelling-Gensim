hark how the mower damon sung with love of juliana stung while everything did seem to paint the scene more fit for his complaint like her fair eyes the day was fair but scorching like his amrous care sharp like his scythe his sorrow was and withered like his hopes the grass  oh what unusual heats are here which thus our sunburned meadows sear the grasshopper its pipe gives oer and hamstringed frogs can dance no more but in the brook the green frog wades and grasshoppers seek out the shades only the snake that kept within now glitters in its second skin  this heat the sun could never raise nor dog star so inflame the days it from an higher beauty growth which burns the fields and mower both which mads the dog and makes the sun hotter than his own phaëton not july causeth these extremes but julianas scorching beams  tell me where i may pass the fires of the hot day or hot desires to what cool cave shall i descend or to what gelid fountain bend alas i look for ease in vain when remedies themselves complain no moisture but my tears do rest nor cold but in her icy breast  how long wilt thou fair shepherdess esteem me and my presents less to thee the harmless snake i bring disarmèd of its teeth and sting to thee chameleons changing hue and oak leaves tipped with honey dew yet thou ungrateful hast not sought nor what they are nor who them brought  i am the mower damon known through all the meadows i have mown on me the morn her dew distills before her darling daffodils and if at noon my toil me heat the sun himself licks off my sweat while going home the evening sweet in cowslipwater bathes my feet  what though the piping shepherd stock the plains with an unnumbered flock this scythe of mine discovers wide more ground than all his sheep do hide with this the golden fleece i shear of all these closes every year and though in wool more poor than they yet am i richer far in hay  nor am i so deformed to sight if in my scythe i lookèd right in which i see my picture done as in a crescent moon the sun the deathless fairies take me oft to lead them in their dances soft and when i tune myself to sing about me they contract their ring  how happy might i still have mowed had not love here his thistles sowed but now i all the day complain joining my labour to my pain and with my scythe cut down the grass yet still my grief is where it was but when the iron blunter grows sighing i whet my scythe and woes  while thus he threw his elbow round depopulating all the ground and with his whistling scythe does cut each stroke between the earth and root the edgèd steel by careless chance did into his own ankle glance and there among the grass fell down by his own scythe the mower mown  alas said he these hurts are slight to those that die by loves despite with shepherdspurse and clownsallheal the blood i staunch and wound i seal only for him no cure is found whom julianas eyes do wound tis death alone that this must do for death thou art a mower too
