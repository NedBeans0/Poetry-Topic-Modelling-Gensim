the wanton troopers riding by have shot my fawn and it will die ungentle men they cannot thrive to kill thee thou neer didst alive them any harm alas nor could thy death yet do them any good im sure i never wishd them ill nor do i for all this nor will but if my simple prayrs may yet prevail with heaven to forget thy murder i will join my tears rather than fail but oh my fears it cannot die so heavens king keeps register of everything and nothing may we use in vain evn beasts must be with justice slain else men are made their deodands though they should wash their guilty hands in this warm lifeblood which doth part from thine and wound me to the heart yet could they not be clean their stain is dyed in such a purple grain there is not such another in the world to offer for their sin  unconstant sylvio when yet i had not found him counterfeit one morning i remember well tied in this silver chain and bell gave it to me nay and i know what he said then im sure i do said he look how your huntsman here hath taught a fawn to hunt his dear but sylvio soon had me beguild this waxed tame while he grew wild and quite regardless of my smart left me his fawn but took his heart  thenceforth i set myself to play my solitary time away with this and very well content could so mine idle life have spent for it was full of sport and light of foot and heart and did invite me to its game it seemd to bless itself in me how could i less than love it oh i cannot be unkind t a beast that loveth me  had it livd long i do not know whether it too might have done so as sylvio did his gifts might be perhaps as false or more than he but i am sure for aught that i could in so short a time espy thy love was far more better then the love of false and cruel men  with sweetest milk and sugar first i it at mine own fingers nurst and as it grew so every day it waxd more white and sweet than they it had so sweet a breath and oft i blushd to see its foot more soft and white shall i say than my hand nay any ladys of the land  it is a wondrous thing how fleet twas on those little silver feet with what a pretty skipping grace it oft would challenge me the race and when t had left me far away twould stay and run again and stay for it was nimbler much than hinds and trod as on the four winds  i have a garden of my own but so with roses overgrown and lilies that you would it guess to be a little wilderness and all the spring time of the year it only loved to be there among the beds of lilies i have sought it oft where it should lie yet could not till itself would rise find it although before mine eyes for in the flaxen lilies shade it like a bank of lilies laid upon the roses it would feed until its lips evn seemed to bleed and then to me twould boldly trip and print those roses on my lip but all its chief delight was still on roses thus itself to fill and its pure virgin limbs to fold in whitest sheets of lilies cold had it livd long it would have been lilies without roses within  o help o help i see it faint and die as calmly as a saint see how it weeps the tears do come sad slowly dropping like a gum so weeps the wounded balsam so the holy frankincense doth flow the brotherless heliades melt in such amber tears as these  i in a golden vial will keep these two crystal tears and fill it till it do oerflow with mine then place it in dianas shrine  now my sweet fawn is vanishd to whither the swans and turtles go in fair elysium to endure with milkwhite lambs and ermines pure o do not run too fast for i will but bespeak thy grave and die  first my unhappy statue shall be cut in marble and withal let it be weeping too but there th engraver sure his art may spare for i so truly thee bemoan that i shall weep though i be stone until my tears still dropping wear my breast themselves engraving there there at my feet shalt thou be laid of purest alabaster made for i would have thine image be white as i can though not as thee
