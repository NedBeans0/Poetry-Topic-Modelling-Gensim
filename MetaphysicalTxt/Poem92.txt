throw away thy rod throw away thy wrath o my god take the gentle path  for my hearts desire unto thine is bent i aspire to a full consent  not a word or look i affect to own but by book and thy book alone  though i fail i weep though i halt in pace yet i creep to the throne of grace  then let wrath remove love will do the deed for with love stony hearts will bleed  love is swift of foot loves a man of war and can shoot and can hit from far  who can scape his bow that which wrought on thee brought thee low needs must work on me  throw away thy rod though man frailties hath thou art god throw away thy wrath
