when for the thorns with which i long too long with many a piercing wound my saviours head have crowned i seek with garlands to redress that wrong through every garden every mead i gather flowers my fruits are only flowers dismantling all the fragrant towers that once adorned my shepherdesss head and now when i have summed up all my store thinking so i myself deceive so rich a chaplet thence to weave as never yet the king of glory wore alas i find the serpent old that twining in his speckled breast about the flowers disguised does fold with wreaths of fame and interest ah foolish man that wouldst debase with them and mortal glory heavens diadem but thou who only couldst the serpent tame either his slippery knots at once untie and disentangle all his winding snare or shatter too with him my curious frame and let these wither so that he may die though set with skill and chosen out with care that they while thou on both their spoils dost tread may crown thy feet that could not crown thy head
