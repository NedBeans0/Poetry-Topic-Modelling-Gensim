when first thou didst entice to thee my heart i thought the service brave so many joys i writ down for my part besides what i might have out of my stock of natural delights augmented with thy gracious benefits  i looked on thy furniture so fine and made it fine to me thy glorious householdstuff did me entwine and tice me unto thee such stars i counted mine both heavn and earth paid me my wages in a world of mirth  what pleasures could i want whose king i servd where joys my fellows were thus argud into hopes my thoughts reservd no place for grief or fear therefore my sudden soul caught at the place and made her youth and fierceness seek thy face  at first thou gavst me milk and sweetnesses i had my wish and way my days were strawd with flowrs and happiness there was no month but may but with my years sorrow did twist and grow and made a party unawares for woe  my flesh began unto my soul in pain sicknesses cleave my bones consuming agues dwell in evry vein and tune my breath to groans sorrow was all my soul i scarce believd till grief did tell me roundly that i livd  when i got health thou tookst away my life and more for my friends die my mirth and edge was lost a blunted knife was of more use than i thus thin and lean without a fence or friend i was blown through with evry storm and wind  whereas my birth and spirit rather took the way that takes the town thou didst betray me to a lingring book and wrap me in a gown i was entangled in the world of strife before i had the power to change my life  yet for i threatend oft the siege to raise not simpring all mine age thou often didst with academic praise melt and dissolve my rage i took thy sweetned pill till i came where i could not go away nor persevere  yet lest perchance i should too happy be in my unhappiness turning my purge to food thou throwest me into more sicknesses thus doth thy power crossbias me not making thine own gift good yet me from my ways taking  now i am here what thou wilt do with me none of my books will show i read and sigh and wish i were a tree for sure then i should grow to fruit or shade at least some bird would trust her household to me and i should be just  yet though thou troublest me i must be meek in weakness must be stout well i will change the service and go seek some other master out ah my dear god though i am clean forgot let me not love thee if i love thee not
