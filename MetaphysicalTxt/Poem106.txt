when god at first made man having a glass of blessings standing by let us said he pour on him all we can let the worlds riches which dispers√®d lie contract into a span  so strength first made a way then beauty flowed then wisdom honour pleasure when almost all was out god made a stay perceiving that alone of all his treasure rest in the bottom lay  for if i should said he bestow this jewel also on my creature he would adore my gifts instead of me and rest in nature not the god of nature so both should losers be  yet let him keep the rest but keep them with repining restlessness let him be rich and weary that at least if goodness lead him not yet weariness may toss him to my breast
