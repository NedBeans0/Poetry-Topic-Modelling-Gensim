o joys infinite sweetness with what flowrs and shoots of glory my soul breaks and buds all the long hours of night and rest through the still shrouds of sleep and clouds this dew fell on my breast oh how it bloods and spirits all my earth hark in what rings and hymning circulations the quick world awakes and sings the rising winds and falling springs birds beasts all things adore him in their kinds thus all is hurld in sacred hymns and order the great chime and symphony of nature prayer is the world in tune a spirit voice and vocal joys whose echo is heavns bliss o let me climb when i lie down the pious soul by night is like a clouded star whose beams though said to shed their light under some cloud yet are above and shine and move beyond that misty shroud so in my bed that curtaind grave though sleep like ashes hide my lamp and life both shall in thee abide
