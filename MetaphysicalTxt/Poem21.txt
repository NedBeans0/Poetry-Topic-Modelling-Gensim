wilt thou forgive that sin where i begun which was my sin though it were done before wilt thou forgive that sin through which i run and do run still though still i do deplore when thou hast done thou hast not done for i have more  wilt thou forgive that sin which i have won others to sin and made my sin their door wilt thou forgive that sin which i did shun a year or two but wallowd in a score when thou hast done thou hast not done for i have more  i have a sin of fear that when i have spun my last thread i shall perish on the shore but swear by thyself that at my death thy son shall shine as he shines now and heretofore and having done that thou hast done i fear no more
