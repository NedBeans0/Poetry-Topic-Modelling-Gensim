my mind was once the true survey of all these meadows fresh and gay and in the greenness of the grass did see its hopes as in a glass when juliana came and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me  but these while i with sorrow pine grew more luxuriant still and fine that not one blade of grass you spyd but had a flower on either side when juliana came and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me  unthankful meadows could you so a fellowship so true forgo and in your gaudy maygames meet while i lay trodden under feet when juliana came and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me  but what you in compassion ought shall now by my revenge be wrought and flowrs and grass and i and all will in one common ruin fall for juliana comes and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me  and thus ye meadows which have been companions of my thoughts more green shall now the heraldry become with which i shall adorn my tomb for juliana comes and she what i do to the grass does to my thoughts and me
