c damon come drive thy flocks this way d no tis too late they went astray c i have a grassy scutcheon spied where flora blazons all her pride the grass i aim to feast thy sheep the flowers i for thy temples keep d grass withers and the flowers too fade c seize the short joys then ere they vade seest thou that unfrequented cave d that den c loves shrine d but virtues grave c in whose cool bosom we may lie safe from the sun d not heavens eye c near this a fountains liquid bell tinkles within the concave shell d might a soul bathe there and be clean or slake its drought c what ist you mean d these once had been enticing things clorinda pastures caves and springs c and what late change d the other day pan met me c what did great pan say d words that transcend poor shepherds skill but he eer since my songs does fill and his name swells my slender oat c sweet must pan sound in damons note d clorindas voice might make it sweet c who would not in pans praises meet  chorus  of pan the flowery pastures sing caves echo and the fountains ring sing then while he doth us inspire for all the world is our pans choir
