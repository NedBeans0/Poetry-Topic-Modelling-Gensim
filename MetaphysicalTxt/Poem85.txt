a broken altar lord thy servant rears made of a heart and cemented with tears whose parts are as thy hand did frame no workmans tool hath touchd the same a heart alone is such a stone as nothing but thy powr doth cut wherefore each part of my hard heart meets in this frame to praise thy name that if i chance to hold my peace these stones to praise thee may not cease oh let thy blessed sacrifice be mine and sanctify this altar to be thine
