they are all gone into the world of light and i alone sit lingring here their very memory is fair and bright and my sad thoughts doth clear  it glows and glitters in my cloudy breast like stars upon some gloomy grove or those faint beams in which this hill is drest after the suns remove  i see them walking in an air of glory whose light doth trample on my days my days which are at best but dull and hoary mere glimmering and decays  o holy hope and high humility high as the heavens above these are your walks and you have showd them me to kindle my cold love  dear beauteous death the jewel of the just shining nowhere but in the dark what mysteries do lie beyond thy dust could man outlook that mark  he that hath found some fledgd birds nest may know at first sight if the bird be flown but what fair well or grove he sings in now that is to him unknown  and yet as angels in some brighter dreams call to the soul when man doth sleep so some strange thoughts transcend our wonted themes and into glory peep  if a star were confind into a tomb her captive flames must needs burn there but when the hand that lockd her up gives room shell shine through all the sphere  o father of eternal life and all created glories under thee resume thy spirit from this world of thrall into true liberty  either disperse these mists which blot and fill my perspective still as they pass or else remove me hence unto that hill where i shall need no glass
