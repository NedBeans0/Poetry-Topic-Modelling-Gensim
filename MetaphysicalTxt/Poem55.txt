how vainly men themselves amaze to win the palm the oak or bays and their uncessant labours see crownd from some single herb or tree whose short and narrow verged shade does prudently their toils upbraid while all flowrs and all trees do close to weave the garlands of repose  fair quiet have i found thee here and innocence thy sister dear mistaken long i sought you then in busy companies of men your sacred plants if here below only among the plants will grow society is all but rude to this delicious solitude  no white nor red was ever seen so amrous as this lovely green fond lovers cruel as their flame cut in these trees their mistress name little alas they know or heed how far these beauties hers exceed fair trees whereseer your barks i wound no name shall but your own be found  when we have run our passions heat love hither makes his best retreat the gods that mortal beauty chase still in a tree did end their race apollo hunted daphne so only that she might laurel grow and pan did after syrinx speed not as a nymph but for a reed  what wondrous life in this i lead ripe apples drop about my head the luscious clusters of the vine upon my mouth do crush their wine the nectarine and curious peach into my hands themselves do reach stumbling on melons as i pass ensnard with flowrs i fall on grass  meanwhile the mind from pleasure less withdraws into its happiness the mind that ocean where each kind does straight its own resemblance find yet it creates transcending these far other worlds and other seas annihilating all thats made to a green thought in a green shade  here at the fountains sliding foot or at some fruit trees mossy root casting the bodys vest aside my soul into the boughs does glide there like a bird it sits and sings then whets and combs its silver wings and till prepard for longer flight waves in its plumes the various light  such was that happy gardenstate while man there walkd without a mate after a place so pure and sweet what other help could yet be meet but twas beyond a mortals share to wander solitary there two paradises twere in one to live in paradise alone  how well the skillful gardner drew of flowrs and herbs this dial new where from above the milder sun does through a fragrant zodiac run and as it works th industrious bee computes its time as well as we how could such sweet and wholesome hours be reckond but with herbs and flowrs
