whatever tis whose beauty here below attracts thee thus and makes thee stream and flow and wind and curl and wink and smile shifting thy gate and guile  though thy close commerce nought at all imbars my present search for eagles eye not stars and still the lesser by the best and highest good is blest  yet seeing all things that subsist and be have their commissions from divinity and teach us duty i will see what man may learn from thee  first i am sure the subject so respected is well disposd for bodies once infected depravd or dead can have with thee no hold nor sympathy  next theres in it a restless pure desire and longing for thy bright and vital fire desire that never will be quenchd nor can be writhd nor wrenchd  these are the magnets which so strongly move and work all night upon thy light and love as beauteous shapes we know not why command and guide the eye  for where desire celestial pure desire hath taken root and grows and doth not tire there god a commerce states and sheds his secret on their heads  this is the heart he craves and who so will but give it him and grudge not he shall feel that god is true as herbs unseen put on their youth and green
