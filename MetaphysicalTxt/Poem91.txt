when my devotions could not pierce thy silent ears then was my heart broken as was my verse my breast was full of fears and disorder  my bent thoughts like a brittle bow did fly asunder each took his way some would to pleasures go some to the wars and thunder of alarms  as good go anywhere they say as to benumb both knees and heart in crying night and day come come my god o come  but no hearing  o that thou shouldst give dust a tongue to cry to thee and then not hear it crying all day long my heart was in my knee but no hearing  therefore my soul lay out of sight untuned unstrung my feeble spirit unable to look right like a nipped blossom hung discontented  o cheer and tune my heartless breast defer no time that so thy favors granting my request they and my mind may chime and mend my rhyme
