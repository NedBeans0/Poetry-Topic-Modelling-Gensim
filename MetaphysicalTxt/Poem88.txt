while that my soul repairs to her devotion here i intomb my flesh that it betimes may take acquaintance of this heap of dust to which the blast of deaths incessant motion fed with the exhalation of our crimes drives all at last therefore i gladly trust  my body to this school that it may learn to spell his elements and find his birth written in dusty heraldry and lines  which dissolution sure doth best discern comparing dust with dust and earth with earth these laugh at jet and marble put for signs  to sever the good fellowship of dust and spoil the meeting what shall point out them when they shall bow and kneel and fall down flat to kiss those heaps which now they have in trust dear flesh while i do pray learn here thy stem and true descent that when thou shalt grow fat  and wanton in thy cravings thou mayst know that flesh is but the glass which holds the dust that measures all our time which also shall be crumbled into dust mark here below how tame these ashes are how free from lust that thou mayst fit thyself against thy fall
