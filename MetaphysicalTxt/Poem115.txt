body   farewell i go to sleep but when the daystar springs ill wake again  soul   go sleep in peace and when thou liest unnumberd in thy dust when all this frame is but one dram and what thou now descriest in sevral parts shall want a name then may his peace be with thee and each dust writ in his book who neer betrayd mans trust  body   amen but hark ere we two stray how many hours dost think till day  soul   ah go thart weak and sleepy heavn is a plain watch and without figures winds all ages up who drew this circle even he fills it days and hours are blinds yet this take with thee the last gasp of time is thy first breath and mans eternal prime
