lord how can man preach thy eternal word he is a brittle crazy glass yet in thy temple thou dost him afford this glorious and transcendent place to be a window through thy grace  but when thou dost anneal in glass thy story making thy life to shine within the holy preachers then the light and glory more reverend grows and more doth win which else shows waterish bleak and thin  doctrine and life colors and light in one when they combine and mingle bring a strong regard and awe but speech alone doth vanish like a flaring thing and in the ear not conscience ring
