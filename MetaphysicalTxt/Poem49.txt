my love is of a birth as rare as tis for object strange and high it was begotten by despair upon impossibility  magnanimous despair alone could show me so divine a thing where feeble hope could neer have flown but vainly flappd its tinsel wing  and yet i quickly might arrive where my extended soul is fixt but fate does iron wedges drive and always crowds itself betwixt  for fate with jealous eye does see two perfect loves nor lets them close their union would her ruin be and her tyrannic powr depose  and therefore her decrees of steel us as the distant poles have placd though loves whole world on us doth wheel not by themselves to be embracd  unless the giddy heaven fall and earth some new convulsion tear and us to join the world should all be crampd into a planisphere  as lines so loves oblique may well themselves in every angle greet but ours so truly parallel though infinite can never meet  therefore the love which us doth bind but fate so enviously debars is the conjunction of the mind and opposition of the stars
