i wonder by my troth what thou and i did till we loved were we not weaned till then but sucked on country pleasures childishly or snorted we in the seven sleepers den twas so but this all pleasures fancies be if ever any beauty i did see which i desired and got twas but a dream of thee  and now goodmorrow to our waking souls which watch not one another out of fear for love all love of other sights controls and makes one little room an everywhere let seadiscoverers to new worlds have gone let maps to other worlds on worlds have shown let us possess one world each hath one and is one  my face in thine eye thine in mine appears and true plain hearts do in the faces rest where can we find two better hemispheres without sharp north without declining west whatever dies was not mixed equally if our two loves be one or thou and i love so alike that none do slacken none can die
