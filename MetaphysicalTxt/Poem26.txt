i long to talk with some old lovers ghost who died before the god of love was born i cannot think that he who then lovd most sunk so low as to love one which did scorn but since this god producd a destiny and that vicenature custom lets it be i must love her that loves not me  sure they which made him god meant not so much nor he in his young godhead practisd it but when an even flame two hearts did touch his office was indulgently to fit actives to passives correspondency only his subject was it cannot be love till i love her that loves me  but every modern god will now extend his vast prerogative as far as jove to rage to lust to write to to commend all is the purlieu of the god of love o were we wakend by this tyranny to ungod this child again it could not be i should love her who loves not me  rebel and atheist too why murmur i as though i felt the worst that love could do love might make me leave loving or might try a deeper plague to make her love me too which since she loves before iam loth to see falsehood is worse than hate and that must be if she whom i love should love me
