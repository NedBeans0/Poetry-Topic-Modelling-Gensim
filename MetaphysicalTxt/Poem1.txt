excerpt  an anatomy of the world wherein by occasion of the untimely death of mistress elizabeth drury the frailty and the decay of this whole world is represented the first anniversary when that rich soul which to her heaven is gone whom all do celebrate who know they have one for who is sure he hath a soul unless it see and judge and follow worthiness and by deeds praise it he who doth not this may lodge an inmate soul but tis not his when that queen ended here her progress time and as ther standing house to heaven did climb where loath to make the saints attend her long shes now a part both of the choir and song this world in that great earthquake languished for in a common bath of tears it bled which drew the strongest vital spirits out but succourd then with a perplexed doubt whether the world did lose or gain in this because since now no other way there is but goodness to see her whom all would see all must endeavour to be good as she this great consumption to a fever turnd and so the world had fits it joyd it mournd and as men think that agues physic are and th ague being spent give over care so thou sick world mistakst thy self to be well when alas thourt in a lethargy her death did wound and tame thee then and then thou mightst have better spard the sun or man that wound was deep but tis more misery that thou hast lost thy sense and memory twas heavy then to hear thy voice of moan but this is worse that thou art speechless grown thou hast forgot thy name thou hadst thou wast nothing but she and her thou hast oerpast for as a child kept from the font until a prince expected long come to fulfill the ceremonies thou unnamd hadst laid had not her coming thee her palace made her name defind thee gave thee form and frame and thou forgetst to celebrate thy name some months she hath been dead but being dead measures of times are all determined but long sheath been away long long yet none offers to tell us who it is thats gone but as in states doubtful of future heirs when sickness without remedy impairs the present prince theyre loath it should be said the prince doth languish or the prince is dead so mankind feeling now a general thaw a strong example gone equal to law the cement which did faithfully compact and glue all virtues now resolvd and slackd thought it some blasphemy to say shwas dead or that our weakness was discovered in that confession therefore spoke no more than tongues the soul being gone the loss deplore but though it be too late to succour thee sick world yea dead yea putrified since she thy intrinsic balm and thy preservative can never be renewd thou never live i since no man can make thee live will try what we may gain by thy anatomy her death hath taught us dearly that thou art corrupt and mortal in thy purest part let no man say the world itself being dead tis labour lost to have discovered the worlds infirmities since there is none alive to study this dissection for theres a kind of world remaining still though she which did inanimate and fill the world be gone yet in this last long night her ghost doth walk that is a glimmering light a faint weak love of virtue and of good reflects from her on them which understood her worth and though she have shut in all day the twilight of her memory doth stay which from the carcass of the old world free creates a new world and new creatures be producd the matter and the stuff of this her virtue and the form our practice is and though to be thus elemented arm these creatures from homeborn intrinsic harm for all assumd unto this dignity so many weedless paradises be which of themselves produce no venomous sin except some foreign serpent bring it in yet because outward storms the strongest break and strength itself by confidence grows weak this new world may be safer being told the dangers and diseases of the old for with due temper men do then forgo or covet things when they their true worth know there is no health physicians say that we at best enjoy but a neutrality and can there be worse sickness than to know that we are never well nor can be so we are born ruinous poor mothers cry that children come not right nor orderly except they headlong come and fall upon an ominous precipitation how wittys ruin how importunate upon mankind it labourd to frustrate even gods purpose and made woman sent for mans relief cause of his languishment they were to good ends and they are so still but accessory and principal in ill for that first marriage was our funeral one woman at one blow then killd us all and singly one by one they kill us now we do delightfully our selves allow to that consumption and profusely blind we kill our selves to propagate our kind and yet we do not that we are not men there is not now that mankind which was then when as the sun and man did seem to strive joint tenants of the world who should survive when stag and raven and the longlivd tree compard with man died in minority when if a slowpacd star had stoln away from the observers marking he might stay two or three hundred years to seet again and then make up his observation plain when as the age was long the size was great mans growth confessd and recompensd the meat so spacious and large that every soul did a fair kingdom and large realm control and when the very stature thus erect did that soul a good way towards heaven direct where is this mankind now who lives to age fit to be made methusalem his page alas we scarce live long enough to try whether a truemade clock run right or lie old grandsires talk of yesterday with sorrow and for our children we reserve tomorrow so short is life that every peasant strives in a torn house or field to have three lives and as in lasting so in length is man contracted to an inch who was a span for had a man at first in forests strayd or shipwrackd in the sea one would have laid a wager that an elephant or whale that met him would not hastily assail a thing so equall to him now alas the fairies and the pigmies well may pass as credible mankind decays so soon weare scarce our fathers shadows cast at noon only death adds tour length nor are we grown in stature to be men till we are none but this were light did our less volume hold all the old text or had we changd to gold their silver or disposd into less glass spirits of virtue which then scatterd was but tis not so ware not retird but dampd and as our bodies so our minds are crampd tis shrinking not close weaving that hath thus in mind and body both bedwarfed us we seem ambitious gods whole work tundo of nothing he made us and we strive too to bring our selves to nothing back and we do what we can to dot so soon as he with new diseases on our selves we war and with new physic a worse engine far thus man this worlds viceemperor in whom all faculties all graces are at home and if in other creatures they appear theyre but mans ministers and legates there to work on their rebellions and reduce them to civility and to mans use this man whom god did woo and loath tattend till man came up did down to man descend this man so great that all that is is his o what a trifle and poor thing he is if man were anything hes nothing now help or at least some time to waste allow this other wants yet when he did depart with her whom we lament he lost his heart she of whom thancients seemd to prophesy when they calld virtues by the name of she she in whom virtue was so much refind that for alloy unto so pure a mind she took the weaker sex she that could drive the poisonous tincture and the stain of eve out of her thoughts and deeds and purify all by a true religious alchemy she she is dead shes dead when thou knowest this thou knowest how poor a trifling thing man is and learnst thus much by our anatomy the heart being perishd no part can be free and that except thou feed not banquet on the supernatural food religion thy better growth grows withered and scant be more than man or thourt less than an ant then as mankind so is the worlds whole frame quite out of joint almost created lame for before god had made up all the rest corruption entred and depravd the best it seizd the angels and then first of all the world did in her cradle take a fall and turnd her brains and took a general maim wronging each joint of thuniversal frame the noblest part man felt it first and then both beasts and plants cursd in the curse of man so did the world from the first hour decay that evening was beginning of the day and now the springs and summers which we see like sons of women after fifty be and new philosophy calls all in doubt the element of fire is quite put out the sun is lost and thearth and no mans wit can well direct him where to look for it and freely men confess that this worlds spent when in the planets and the firmament they seek so many new they see that this is crumbled out again to his atomies tis all in pieces all coherence gone all just supply and all relation prince subject father son are things forgot for every man alone thinks he hath got to be a phoenix and that then can be none of that kind of which he is but he this is the worlds condition now and now she that should all parts to reunion bow she that had all magnetic force alone to draw and fasten sundred parts in one she whom wise nature had invented then when she observd that every sort of men did in their voyage in this worlds sea stray and needed a new compass for their way she that was best and first original of all fair copies and the general steward to fate she whose rich eyes and breast gilt the west indies and perfumd the east whose having breathd in this world did bestow spice on those isles and bade them still smell so and that rich india which doth gold inter is but as single money coind from her she to whom this world must it self refer as suburbs or the microcosm of her she she is dead shes dead when thou knowst this thou knowst how lame a cripple this world is
