how fresh oh lord how sweet and clean are thy returns even as the flowers in spring to which besides their own demean the latepast frosts tributes of pleasure bring grief melts away like snow in may as if there were no such cold thing  who would have thought my shriveled heart could have recovered greenness it was gone quite underground as flowers depart to see their motherroot when they have blown where they together all the hard weather dead to the world keep house unknown  these are thy wonders lord of power killing and quickening bringing down to hell and up to heaven in an hour making a chiming of a passingbell we say amiss this or that is thy word is all if we could spell  oh that i once past changing were fast in thy paradise where no flower can wither many a spring i shoot up fair offering at heaven growing and groaning thither nor doth my flower want a spring shower my sins and i joining together  but while i grow in a straight line still upwards bent as if heaven were mine own thy anger comes and i decline what frost to that what pole is not the zone where all things burn when thou dost turn and the least frown of thine is shown  and now in age i bud again after so many deaths i live and write i once more smell the dew and rain and relish versing oh my only light it cannot be that i am he on whom thy tempests fell all night  these are thy wonders lord of love to make us see we are but flowers that glide which when we once can find and prove thou hast a garden for us where to bide who would be more swelling through store forfeit their paradise by their pride
