clora come view my soul and tell whether i have contrived it well now all its several lodgings lie composed into one gallery and the great arrashangings made of various faces by are laid that for all furniture youll find only your picture in my mind  here thou are painted in the dress of an inhuman murderess examining upon our hearts thy fertile shop of cruel arts engines more keen than ever yet adorned a tyrants cabinet of which the most tormenting are black eyes red lips and curlèd hair  but on the other side thart drawn like to aurora in the dawn when in the east she slumbering lies and stretches out her milky thighs while all the morning choir does sing and manna falls and roses spring and at thy feet the wooing doves sit pérfecting their harmless loves  like an enchantress here thou showst vexing thy restless lovers ghost and by a light obscure dost rave over his entrails in the cave divining thence with horrid care how long thou shalt continue fair and when informed them throwst away to be the greedy vultures prey  but against that thou sitst afloat like venus in her pearly boat the halcyons calming all thats nigh betwixt the air and water fly or if some rolling wave appears a mass of ambergris it bears nor blows more wind than what may well convoy the perfume to the smell  these pictures and a thousand more of thee my gallery do store in all the forms thou canst invent either to please me or torment for thou alone to people me art grown a numerous colony and a collection choicer far than or whitehalls or mantuas were  but of these pictures and the rest that at the entrance likes me best where the same posture and the look remains with which i first was took a tender shepherdess whose hair hangs loosely playing in the air transplanting flowers from the green hill to crown her head and bosom fill
