lord who createdst man in wealth and store though foolishly he lost the same decaying more and more till he became most poore with thee o let me rise as larks harmoniously and sing this day thy victories then shall the fall further the flight in me  my tender age in sorrow did beginne and still with sicknesses and shame thou didst so punish sinne that i became most thinne with thee let me combine and feel thy victorie for if i imp my wing on thine affliction shall advance the flight in me
