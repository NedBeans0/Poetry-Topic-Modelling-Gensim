how should i praise thee lord how should my rhymes gladly engrave thy love in steel if what my soul doth feel sometimes my soul might ever feel  although there were some forty heavns or more sometimes i peer above them all sometimes i hardly reach a score sometimes to hell i fall  o rack me not to such a vast extent those distances belong to thee the worlds too little for thy tent a grave too big for me  wilt thou meet arms with man that thou dost stretch a crumb of dust from heavn to hell will great god measure with a wretch shall he thy stature spell  o let me when thy roof my soul hath hid o let me roost and nestle there then of a sinner thou art rid and i of hope and fear  yet take thy way for sure thy way is best stretch or contract me thy poor debtor this is but tuning of my breast to make the music better  whether i fly with angels fall with dust thy hands made both and i am there thy power and love my love and trust make one place evrywhere
