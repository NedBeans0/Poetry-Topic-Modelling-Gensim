where like a pillow on a bed a pregnant bank swelld up to rest the violets reclining head sat we two one anothers best our hands were firmly cemented with a fast balm which thence did spring our eyebeams twisted and did thread our eyes upon one double string so tointergraft our hands as yet was all the means to make us one and pictures in our eyes to get was all our propagation as twixt two equal armies fate suspends uncertain victory our souls which to advance their state were gone out hung twixt her and me and whilst our souls negotiate there we like sepulchral statues lay all day the same our postures were and we said nothing all the day if any so by love refind that he souls language understood and by good love were grown all mind within convenient distance stood he though he knew not which soul spake because both meant both spake the same might thence a new concoction take and part far purer than he came this ecstasy doth unperplex we said and tell us what we love we see by this it was not sex we see we saw not what did move but as all several souls contain mixture of things they know not what love these mixd souls doth mix again and makes both one each this and that a single violet transplant the strength the colour and the size all which before was poor and scant redoubles still and multiplies when love with one another so interinanimates two souls that abler soul which thence doth flow defects of loneliness controls we then who are this new soul know of what we are composd and made for th atomies of which we grow are souls whom no change can invade but oh alas so long so far our bodies why do we forbear theyare ours though theyare not we we are the intelligences they the spheres we owe them thanks because they thus did us to us at first convey yielded their senses force to us nor are dross to us but allay on man heavens influence works not so but that it first imprints the air so soul into the soul may flow though it to body first repair as our blood labors to beget spirits as like souls as it can because such fingers need to knit that subtle knot which makes us man so must pure lovers souls descend t affections and to faculties which sense may reach and apprehend else a great prince in prison lies toour bodies turn we then that so weak men on love reveald may look loves mysteries in souls do grow but yet the body is his book and if some lover such as we have heard this dialogue of one let him still mark us he shall see small change when weare to bodies gone
