i scarce believe my love to be so pure as i had thought it was because it doth endure vicissitude and season as the grass methinks i lied all winter when i swore my love was infinite if spring make it more  but if medicine love which cures all sorrow with more not only be no quintessence but mixed of all stuffs paining soul or sense and of the sun his working vigor borrow loves not so pure and abstract as they use to say which have no mistress but their muse but as all else being elemented too love sometimes would contemplate sometimes do  and yet no greater but more eminent love by the spring is grown as in the firmament stars by the sun are not enlarged but shown gentle love deeds as blossoms on a bough from loves awakened root do bud out now  if as water stirred more circles be produced by one love such additions take those like so many spheres but one heaven make for they are all concentric unto thee and though each spring do add to love new heat as princes do in time of action get new taxes and remit them not in peace no winter shall abate the springs increase
