he could not die when trees were green for he loved the time too well his little hands when flowers were seen were held for the bluebell as he was carried oer the green  his eye glanced at the whitenosed bee he knew those children of the spring when he was well and on the lea he held one in his hands to sing which filled his heart with glee  infants the children of the spring how can an infant die when butterflies are on the wing green grass and such a sky how can they die at spring  he held his hands for daisies white and then for violets blue and took them all to bed at night that in the green fields grew as childhoods sweet delight  and then he shut his little eyes and flowers would notice not birds nests and eggs caused no surprise he now no blossoms got they met with plaintive sighs  when winter came and blasts did sigh and bare were plain and tree as he for ease in bed did lie his soul seemed with the free he died so quietly
