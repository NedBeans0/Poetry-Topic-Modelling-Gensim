excerpt i rode one evening with count maddalo upon the bank of land which breaks the flow of adria towards venice a bare strand of hillocks heapd from evershifting sand matted with thistles and amphibious weeds such as from earths embrace the salt ooze breeds is this an uninhabited seaside which the lone fisher when his nets are dried abandons and no other object breaks the waste but one dwarf tree and some few stakes broken and unrepaird and the tide makes a narrow space of level sand thereon where twas our wont to ride while day went down this ride was my delight i love all waste and solitary places where we taste the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a rememberd friend i love to ride as then i rode for the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare strippd to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth harmonizing with solitude and sent into our hearts aëreal merriment so as we rode we talkd and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingerd not but flew from brain to brainsuch glee was ours chargd with light memories of rememberd hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argud against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side the sense that he was greater than his kind had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light meanwhile the sun pausd ere it should alight over the horizon of the mountainsoh how beautiful is sunset when the glow of heaven descends upon a land like thee thou paradise of exiles italy thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircle it was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then just where we had dismounted the counts men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood which lay between the city and the shore pavd with the image of the sky the hoar and aëry alps towards the north appeard through mist an heavensustaining bulwark reard between the east and west and half the sky was roofd with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet pausd in his descent among the manyfolded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peakèd isles and thenas if the earth and sea had been dissolvd into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent ere it fade said my companion i will show you soon a better stationso oer the lagune we glided and from that funereal bark i leand and saw the city and could mark how from their many isles in evenings gleam its temples and its palaces did seem like fabrics of enchantment pild to heaven i was about to speak whenwe are even now at the point i meant said maddalo and bade the gondolieri cease to row look julian on the west and listen well if you hear not a deep and heavy bell i lookd and saw between us and the sun a building on an island such a one as age to age might add for uses vile a windowless deformd and dreary pile and on the top an open tower where hung a bell which in the radiance swayd and swung we could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue the broad sun sunk behind it and it tolld in strong and black relief what we behold shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower said maddalo and ever at this hour those who may cross the water hear that bell which calls the maniacs each one from his cell to vespers as much skill as need to pray in thanks or hope for their dark lot have they to their stern maker i replied o ho you talk as in years past said maddalo  tis strange men change not you were ever still among christs flock a perilous infidel a wolf for the meek lambsif you cant swim beware of providence i lookd on him but the gay smile had faded in his eye and such he cried is our mortality and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heavenillumind tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below round the rent heart and prayas madmen do for what they know nottill the night of death as sunset that strange vision severeth our memory from itself and us from all we sought and yet were baffled i recall the sense of what he said although i mar the force of his expressions the broad star of day meanwhile had sunk behind the hill and the black bell became invisible and the red tower lookd gray and all between the churches ships and palaces were seen huddled in gloominto the purple sea the orange hues of heaven sunk silently we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyd me to my lodgings by the way  the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i calld on him and whilst i waited with his child i playd a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyesoh speak not of her eyeswhich seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me she was a special favourite i had nursd her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemd to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changd than she was by six months or so for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count enterd salutations past the word you spoke last night might well have cast a darkness on my spiritif man be the passive thing you say i should not see much harm in the religions and old saws though i may never own such leaden laws which break a teachless nature to the yoke mine is another faiththus much i spoke and noting he replied not added see this lovely child blithe innocent and free she spends a happy time with little care while we to such sick thoughts subjected are as came on you last night it is our will that thus enchains us to permitted ill we might be otherwise we might be all we dream of happy high majestical where is the love beauty and truth we seek but in our mind and if we were not weak should we be less in deed than in desire ay if we were not weakand we aspire how vainly to be strong said maddalo you talk utopia it remains to know i then rejoind and those who try may find how strong the chains are which our spirit bind brittle perchance as straw we are assurd much may be conquerd much may be endurd of what degrades and crushes us we know that we have power over ourselves to do and sufferwhat we know not till we try but something nobler than to live and die so taught those kings of old philosophy who reignd before religion made men blind and those who suffer with their suffering kind yet feel their faith religion my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutationtight as far as words go i knew one like you who to this city came some months ago with whom i argud in this sort and he is now gone madand so he answerd me poor fellow but if you would like to go well visit him and his wild talk will show how vain are such aspiring theories i hope to prove the induction otherwise and that a want of that true theory still which seeks a soul of goodness in things ill or in himself or others has thus bowd his being there are some by nature proud who patient in all else demand but this to love and be belovd with gentleness and being scornd what wonder if they die some living death this is not destiny but mans own wilful ill  as thus i spoke servants announcd the gondola and we through the fastfalling rain and highwrought sea saild to the island where the madhouse stands
