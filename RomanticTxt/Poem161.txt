part i  tis the middle of night by the castle clock and the owls have awakened the crowing cock tuwhit tuwhoo and hark again the crowing cock how drowsily it crew sir leoline the baron rich hath a toothless mastiff bitch from her kennel beneath the rock she maketh answer to the clock four for the quarters and twelve for the hour ever and aye by shine and shower sixteen short howls not over loud some say she sees my ladys shroud  is the night chilly and dark the night is chilly but not dark the thin gray cloud is spread on high it covers but not hides the sky the moon is behind and at the full and yet she looks both small and dull the night is chill the cloud is gray tis a month before the month of may and the spring comes slowly up this way  the lovely lady christabel whom her father loves so well what makes her in the wood so late a furlong from the castle gate she had dreams all yesternight of her own betrothèd knight and she in the midnight wood will pray for the weal of her lover thats far away  she stole along she nothing spoke the sighs she heaved were soft and low and naught was green upon the oak but moss and rarest misletoe she kneels beneath the huge oak tree and in silence prayeth she  the lady sprang up suddenly the lovely lady christabel it moaned as near as near can be but what it is she cannot tell on the other side it seems to be of the huge broadbreasted old oak tree  the night is chill the forest bare is it the wind that moaneth bleak there is not wind enough in the air to move away the ringlet curl from the lovely ladys cheek there is not wind enough to twirl the one red leaf the last of its clan that dances as often as dance it can hanging so light and hanging so high on the topmost twig that looks up at the sky  hush beating heart of christabel jesu maria shield her well she folded her arms beneath her cloak and stole to the other side of the oak what sees she there  there she sees a damsel bright drest in a silken robe of white that shadowy in the moonlight shone the neck that made that white robe wan her stately neck and arms were bare her blueveined feet unsandld were and wildly glittered here and there the gems entangled in her hair i guess twas frightful there to see a lady so richly clad as she beautiful exceedingly  mary mother save me now said christabel and who art thou  the lady strange made answer meet and her voice was faint and sweet have pity on my sore distress i scarce can speak for weariness stretch forth thy hand and have no fear said christabel how camest thou here and the lady whose voice was faint and sweet did thus pursue her answer meet  my sire is of a noble line and my name is geraldine five warriors seized me yestermorn me even me a maid forlorn they choked my cries with force and fright and tied me on a palfrey white the palfrey was as fleet as wind and they rode furiously behind they spurred amain their steeds were white and once we crossed the shade of night as sure as heaven shall rescue me i have no thought what men they be nor do i know how long it is for i have lain entranced i wis since one the tallest of the five took me from the palfreys back a weary woman scarce alive some muttered words his comrades spoke he placed me underneath this oak he swore they would return with haste whither they went i cannot tell i thought i heard some minutes past sounds as of a castle bell stretch forth thy hand thus ended she and help a wretched maid to flee  then christabel stretched forth her hand and comforted fair geraldine o well bright dame may you command the service of sir leoline and gladly our stout chivalry will he send forth and friends withal to guide and guard you safe and free home to your noble fathers hall  she rose and forth with steps they passed that strove to be and were not fast her gracious stars the lady blest and thus spake on sweet christabel all our household are at rest the hall as silent as the cell sir leoline is weak in health and may not well awakened be but we will move as if in stealth and i beseech your courtesy this night to share your couch with me  they crossed the moat and christabel took the key that fitted well a little door she opened straight all in the middle of the gate the gate that was ironed within and without where an army in battle array had marched out the lady sank belike through pain and christabel with might and main lifted her up a weary weight over the threshold of the gate then the lady rose again and moved as she were not in pain  so free from danger free from fear they crossed the court right glad they were and christabel devoutly cried to the lady by her side praise we the virgin all divine who hath rescued thee from thy distress alas alas said geraldine i cannot speak for weariness so free from danger free from fear they crossed the court right glad they were  outside her kennel the mastiff old lay fast asleep in moonshine cold the mastiff old did not awake yet she an angry moan did make and what can ail the mastiff bitch never till now she uttered yell beneath the eye of christabel perhaps it is the owlets scritch for what can ail the mastiff bitch  they passed the hall that echoes still pass as lightly as you will the brands were flat the brands were dying amid their own white ashes lying but when the lady passed there came a tongue of light a fit of flame and christabel saw the ladys eye and nothing else saw she thereby save the boss of the shield of sir leoline tall which hung in a murky old niche in the wall o softly tread said christabel my father seldom sleepeth well  sweet christabel her feet doth bare and jealous of the listening air they steal their way from stair to stair now in glimmer and now in gloom and now they pass the barons room as still as death with stifled breath and now have reached her chamber door and now doth geraldine press down the rushes of the chamber floor  the moon shines dim in the open air and not a moonbeam enters here but they without its light can see the chamber carved so curiously carved with figures strange and sweet all made out of the carvers brain for a ladys chamber meet the lamp with twofold silver chain is fastened to an angels feet  the silver lamp burns dead and dim but christabel the lamp will trim she trimmed the lamp and made it bright and left it swinging to and fro while geraldine in wretched plight sank down upon the floor below  o weary lady geraldine i pray you drink this cordial wine it is a wine of virtuous powers my mother made it of wild flowers  and will your mother pity me who am a maiden most forlorn christabel answeredwoe is me she died the hour that i was born i have heard the greyhaired friar tell how on her deathbed she did say that she should hear the castlebell strike twelve upon my weddingday o mother dear that thou wert here i would said geraldine she were  but soon with altered voice said she off wandering mother peak and pine i have power to bid thee flee alas what ails poor geraldine why stares she with unsettled eye can she the bodiless dead espy  and why with hollow voice cries she off woman off this hour is mine though thou her guardian spirit be off woman off tis given to me  then christabel knelt by the ladys side and raised to heaven her eyes so blue alas said she this ghastly ride dear lady it hath wildered you the lady wiped her moist cold brow and faintly said  tis over now  again the wildflower wine she drank her fair large eyes gan glitter bright and from the floor whereon she sank the lofty lady stood upright she was most beautiful to see like a lady of a far countrèe  and thus the lofty lady spake all they who live in the upper sky do love you holy christabel and you love them and for their sake and for the good which me befel even i in my degree will try fair maiden to requite you well but now unrobe yourself for i must pray ere yet in bed i lie  quoth christabel so let it be and as the lady bade did she her gentle limbs did she undress and lay down in her loveliness  but through her brain of weal and woe so many thoughts moved to and fro that vain it were her lids to close so halfway from the bed she rose and on her elbow did recline to look at the lady geraldine  beneath the lamp the lady bowed and slowly rolled her eyes around then drawing in her breath aloud like one that shuddered she unbound the cincture from beneath her breast her silken robe and inner vest dropt to her feet and full in view behold her bosom and half her side a sight to dream of not to tell o shield her shield sweet christabel  yet geraldine nor speaks nor stirs ah what a stricken look was hers deep from within she seems halfway to lift some weight with sick assay and eyes the maid and seeks delay then suddenly as one defied collects herself in scorn and pride and lay down by the maidens side and in her arms the maid she took ah weladay and with low voice and doleful look these words did say in the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell which is lord of thy utterance christabel thou knowest tonight and wilt know tomorrow this mark of my shame this seal of my sorrow but vainly thou warrest for this is alone in thy power to declare that in the dim forest thou heardst a low moaning and foundst a bright lady surpassingly fair and didst bring her home with thee in love and in charity to shield her and shelter her from the damp air  the conclusion to part i  it was a lovely sight to see the lady christabel when she was praying at the old oak tree amid the jaggèd shadows of mossy leafless boughs kneeling in the moonlight to make her gentle vows her slender palms together prest heaving sometimes on her breast her face resigned to bliss or bale her face oh call it fair not pale and both blue eyes more bright than clear each about to have a tear  with open eyes ah woe is me asleep and dreaming fearfully fearfully dreaming yet i wis dreaming that alone which is o sorrow and shame can this be she the lady who knelt at the old oak tree and lo the worker of these harms that holds the maiden in her arms seems to slumber still and mild as a mother with her child  a star hath set a star hath risen o geraldine since arms of thine have been the lovely ladys prison o geraldine one hour was thine thoust had thy will by tairn and rill the nightbirds all that hour were still but now they are jubilant anew from cliffand tower tuwhoo tuwhoo tuwhoo tuwhoo from wood and fell  and see the lady christabel gathers herself from out her trance her limbs relax her countenance grows sad and soft the smooth thin lids close oer her eyes and tears she sheds large tears that leave the lashes bright and oft the while she seems to smile as infants at a sudden light  yea she doth smile and she doth weep like a youthful hermitess beauteous in a wilderness who praying always prays in sleep and if she move unquietly perchance tis but the blood so free comes back and tingles in her feet no doubt she hath a vision sweet what if her guardian spirit twere what if she knew her mother near but this she knows in joys and woes that saints will aid if men will call for the blue sky bends over all  part ii  each matin bell the baron saith knells us back to a world of death these words sir leoline first said when he rose and found his lady dead these words sir leoline will say many a morn to his dying day  and hence the custom and law began that still at dawn the sacristan who duly pulls the heavy bell five and forty beads must tell between each strokea warning knell which not a soul can choose but hear from bratha head to wyndermere  saith bracy the bard so let it knell and let the drowsy sacristan still count as slowly as he can there is no lack of such i ween as well fill up the space between in langdale pike and witchs lair and dungeonghyll so foully rent with ropes of rock and bells of air three sinful sextons ghosts are pent who all give back one after tother the deathnote to their living brother and oft too by the knell offended just as their one two three is ended the devil mocks the doleful tale with a merry peal from borodale  the air is still through mist and cloud that merry peal comes ringing loud and geraldine shakes off her dread and rises lightly from the bed puts on her silken vestments white and tricks her hair in lovely plight and nothing doubting of her spell awakens the lady christabel sleep you sweet lady christabel i trust that you have rested well  and christabel awoke and spied the same who lay down by her side o rather say the same whom she raised up beneath the old oak tree nay fairer yet and yet more fair for she belike hath drunken deep of all the blessedness of sleep and while she spake her looks her air such gentle thankfulness declare that so it seemed her girded vests grew tight beneath her heaving breasts sure i have sinnd said christabel now heaven be praised if all be well  and in low faltering tones yet sweet did she the lofty lady greet with such perplexity of mind as dreams too lively leave behind  so quickly she rose and quickly arrayed her maiden limbs and having prayed that he who on the cross did groan might wash away her sins unknown she forthwith led fair geraldine to meet her sire sir leoline  the lovely maid and the lady tall are pacing both into the hall and pacing on through page and groom enter the barons presenceroom  the baron rose and while he prest his gentle daughter to his breast with cheerful wonder in his eyes the lady geraldine espies and gave such welcome to the same as might beseem so bright a dame  but when he heard the ladys tale and when she told her fathers name why waxed sir leoline so pale murmuring oer the name again lord roland de vaux of tryermaine alas they had been friends in youth but whispering tongues can poison truth and constancy lives in realms above and life is thorny and youth is vain and to be wroth with one we love doth work like madness in the brain and thus it chanced as i divine with roland and sir leoline each spake words of high disdain and insult to his hearts best brother they partedneer to meet again but never either found another to free the hollow heart from paining they stood aloof the scars remaining like cliffs which had been rent asunder a dreary sea now flows between but neither heat nor frost nor thunder shall wholly do away i ween the marks of that which once hath been  sir leoline a moments space stood gazing on the damsels face and the youthful lord of tryermaine came back upon his heart again  o then the baron forgot his age his noble heart swelled high with rage he swore by the wounds in jesus side he would proclaim it far and wide with trump and solemn heraldry that they who thus had wronged the dame were base as spotted infamy and if they dare deny the same my herald shall appoint a week and let the recreant traitors seek my tourney courtthat there and then i may dislodge their reptile souls from the bodies and forms of men he spake his eye in lightning rolls for the lady was ruthlessly seized and he kenned in the beautiful lady the child of his friend  and now the tears were on his face and fondly in his arms he took fair geraldine who met the embrace prolonging it with joyous look which when she viewed a vision fell upon the soul of christabel the vision of fear the touch and pain she shrunk and shuddered and saw again ah woe is me was it for thee thou gentle maid such sights to see  again she saw that bosom old again she felt that bosom cold and drew in her breath with a hissing sound whereat the knight turned wildly round and nothing saw but his own sweet maid with eyes upraised as one that prayed  the touch the sight had passed away and in its stead that vision blest which comforted her afterrest while in the ladys arms she lay had put a rapture in her breast and on her lips and oer her eyes spread smiles like light with new surprise what ails then my belovèd child the baron saidhis daughter mild made answer all will yet be well i ween she had no power to tell aught else so mighty was the spell  yet he who saw this geraldine had deemed her sure a thing divine such sorrow with such grace she blended as if she feared she had offended sweet christabel that gentle maid and with such lowly tones she prayed she might be sent without delay home to her fathers mansion nay nay by my soul said leoline ho bracy the bard the charge be thine go thou with sweet music and loud and take two steeds with trappings proud and take the youth whom thou lovst best to bear thy harp and learn thy song and clothe you both in solemn vest and over the mountains haste along lest wandering folk that are abroad detain you on the valley road  and when he has crossed the irthing flood my merry bard he hastes he hastes up knorren moor through halegarth wood and reaches soon that castle good which stands and threatens scotlands wastes  bard bracy bard bracy your horses are fleet ye must ride up the hall your music so sweet more loud than your horses echoing feet and loud and loud to lord roland call thy daughter is safe in langdale hall thy beautiful daughter is safe and free sir leoline greets thee thus through me he bids thee come without delay with all thy numerous array and take thy lovely daughter home and he will meet thee on the way with all his numerous array white with their panting palfreys foam and by mine honour i will say that i repent me of the day when i spake words of fierce disdain to roland de vaux of tryermaine for since that evil hour hath flown many a summers sun hath shone yet neer found i a friend again like roland de vaux of tryermaine  the lady fell and clasped his knees her face upraised her eyes oerflowing and bracy replied with faltering voice his gracious hail on all bestowing thy words thou sire of christabel are sweeter than my harp can tell yet might i gain a boon of thee this day my journey should not be so strange a dream hath come to me that i had vowed with music loud to clear yon wood from thing unblest warned by a vision in my rest for in my sleep i saw that dove that gentle bird whom thou dost love and callst by thy own daughters name sir leoline i saw the same fluttering and uttering fearful moan among the green herbs in the forest alone which when i saw and when i heard i wonderd what might ail the bird for nothing near it could i see save the grass and green herbs underneath the old tree  and in my dream methought i went to search out what might there be found and what the sweet birds trouble meant that thus lay fluttering on the ground i went and peered and could descry no cause for her distressful cry but yet for her dear ladys sake i stooped methought the dove to take when lo i saw a bright green snake coiled around its wings and neck green as the herbs on which it couched close by the doves its head it crouched and with the dove it heaves and stirs swelling its neck as she swelled hers i woke it was the midnight hour the clock was echoing in the tower but though my slumber was gone by this dream it would not pass away it seems to live upon my eye  and thence i vowed this selfsame day with music strong and saintly song to wander through the forest bare lest aught unholy loiter there  thus bracy said the baron the while halflistening heard him with a smile then turned to lady geraldine his eyes made up of wonder and love and said in courtly accents fine sweet maid lord rolands beauteous dove with arms more strong than harp or song thy sire and i will crush the snake he kissed her forehead as he spake and geraldine in maiden wise casting down her large bright eyes with blushing cheek and courtesy fine she turned her from sir leoline softly gathering up her train that oer her right arm fell again and folded her arms across her chest and couched her head upon her breast and looked askance at christabel jesu maria shield her well  a snakes small eye blinks dull and shy and the ladys eyes they shrunk in her head each shrunk up to a serpents eye and with somewhat of malice and more of dread at christabel she looked askance one momentand the sight was fled but christabel in dizzy trance stumbling on the unsteady ground shuddered aloud with a hissing sound and geraldine again turned round and like a thing that sought relief full of wonder and full of grief she rolled her large bright eyes divine wildly on sir leoline  the maid alas her thoughts are gone she nothing seesno sight but one the maid devoid of guile and sin i know not how in fearful wise so deeply she had drunken in that look those shrunken serpent eyes that all her features were resigned to this sole image in her mind and passively did imitate that look of dull and treacherous hate and thus she stood in dizzy trance still picturing that look askance with forced unconscious sympathy full before her fathers view as far as such a look could be in eyes so innocent and blue  and when the trance was oer the maid paused awhile and inly prayed then falling at the barons feet by my mothers soul do i entreat that thou this woman send away she said and more she could not say for what she knew she could not tell oermastered by the mighty spell  why is thy cheek so wan and wild sir leoline thy only child lies at thy feet thy joy thy pride so fair so innocent so mild the same for whom thy lady died o by the pangs of her dear mother think thou no evil of thy child for her and thee and for no other she prayed the moment ere she died prayed that the babe for whom she died might prove her dear lords joy and pride that prayer her deadly pangs beguiled sir leoline and wouldst thou wrong thy only child her child and thine  within the barons heart and brain if thoughts like these had any share they only swelled his rage and pain and did but work confusion there his heart was cleft with pain and rage his cheeks they quivered his eyes were wild dishonoured thus in his old age dishonoured by his only child and all his hospitality to the wronged daughter of his friend by more than womans jealousy brought thus to a disgraceful end he rolled his eye with stern regard upon the gentle minstrel bard and said in tones abrupt austere why bracy dost thou loiter here i bade thee hence the bard obeyed and turning from his own sweet maid the agèd knight sir leoline led forth the lady geraldine  the conclusion to part ii  a little child a limber elf singing dancing to itself a fairy thing with red round cheeks that always finds and never seeks makes such a vision to the sight as fills a fathers eyes with light and pleasures flow in so thick and fast upon his heart that he at last must needs express his loves excess with words of unmeant bitterness perhaps tis pretty to force together thoughts so all unlike each other to mutter and mock a broken charm to dally with wrong that does no harm perhaps tis tender too and pretty at each wild word to feel within a sweet recoil of love and pity and what if in a world of sin o sorrow and shame should this be true such giddiness of heart and brain comes seldom save from rage and pain so talks as it s most used to do
