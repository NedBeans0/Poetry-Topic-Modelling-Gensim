the sun is warm the sky is clear the waves are dancing fast and bright blue isles and snowy mountains wear the purple noons transparent might the breath of the moist earth is light around its unexpanded buds like many a voice of one delight the winds the birds the ocean floods the citys voice itself is soft like solitudes  i see the deeps untrampled floor with green and purple seaweeds strown i see the waves upon the shore like light dissolved in starshowers thrown i sit upon the sands alone the lightning of the noontide ocean is flashing round me and a tone arises from its measured motion how sweet did any heart now share in my emotion  alas i have nor hope nor health nor peace within nor calm around nor that content surpassing wealth the sage in meditation found and walked with inward glory crowned nor fame nor power nor love nor leisure others i see whom these surround smiling they live and call life pleasure to me that cup has been dealt in another measure  yet now despair itself is mild even as the winds and waters are i could lie down like a tired child and weep away the life of care which i have borne and yet must bear till death like sleep might steal on me and i might feel in the warm air my cheek grow cold and hear the sea breathe oer my dying brain its last monotony  some might lament that i were cold as i when this sweet day is gone which my lost heart too soon grown old insults with this untimely moan they might lamentfor i am one whom men love notand yet regret unlike this day which when the sun shall on its stainless glory set will linger though enjoyed like joy in memory yet
