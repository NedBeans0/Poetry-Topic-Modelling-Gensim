my silks and fine array my smiles and languishd air by love are drivn away and mournful lean despair brings me yew to deck my grave such end true lovers have  his face is fair as heavn when springing buds unfold o why to him wast givn whose heart is wintry cold his breast is loves all worshipd tomb where all loves pilgrims come  bring me an axe and spade bring me a winding sheet when i my grave have made let winds and tempests beat then down ill lie as cold as clay true love doth pass away
