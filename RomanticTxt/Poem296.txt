and wherefore do the poor complain the rich man asked of me come walk abroad with me i said and i will answer thee  twas evening and the frozen streets were cheerless to behold and we were wrapt and coated well and yet we were acold  we met an old bareheaded man his locks were few and white i askd him what he did abroad in that cold winters night  twas bitter keen indeed he said but at home no fire had he and therefore he had come abroad to ask for charity  we met a young barefooted child and she beggd loud and bold i askd her what she did abroad when the wind it blew so cold  she said her father was at home and he lay sick abed and therefore was it she was sent abroad to beg for bread  we saw a woman sitting down upon a stone to rest she had a baby at her back and another at her breast  i askd her why she loiterd there when the wind it was so chill she turnd her head and bade the child that screamd behind be still  she told us that her husband served a soldier far away and therefore to her parish she was begging back her way  we met a girl her dress was loose and sunken was her eye who with the wantons hollow voice addressd the passers by  i askd her what there was in guilt that could her heart allure to shame disease and late remorse she answerd she was poor  i turnd me to the rich man then for silently stood he you askd me why the poor complain and these have answerd thee
