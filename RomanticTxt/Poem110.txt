i wandered lonely as a cloud that floats on high oer vales and hills when all at once i saw a crowd a host of golden daffodils beside the lake beneath the trees fluttering and dancing in the breeze  continuous as the stars that shine and twinkle on the milky way they stretched in neverending line along the margin of a bay ten thousand saw i at a glance tossing their heads in sprightly dance  the waves beside them danced but they outdid the sparkling waves in glee a poet could not but be gay in such a jocund company i gazedand gazedbut little thought what wealth the show to me had brought  for oft when on my couch i lie in vacant or in pensive mood they flash upon that inward eye which is the bliss of solitude and then my heart with pleasure fills and dances with the daffodils
