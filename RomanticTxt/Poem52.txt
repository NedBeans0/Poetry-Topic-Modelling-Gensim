how sweet i roamd from field to field and tasted all the summers pride till i the prince of love beheld who in the sunny beams did glide  he shewd me lilies for my hair and blushing roses for my brow he led me through his gardens fair where all his golden pleasures grow  with sweet may dews my wings were wet and phoebus fird my vocal rage he caught me in his silken net and shut me in his golden cage  he loves to sit and hear me sing then laughing sports and plays with me then stretches out my golden wing and mocks my loss of liberty
