like the ghost of a dear friend dead is time long past a tone which is now forever fled a hope which is now forever past a love so sweet it could not last was time long past  there were sweet dreams in the night of time long past and was it sadness or delight each day a shadow onward cast which made us wish it yet might last that time long past  there is regret almost remorse for time long past tis like a childs belov√®d corse a father watches till at last beauty is like remembrance cast from time long past
