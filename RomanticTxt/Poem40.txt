my mother bore me in the southern wild and i am black but o my soul is white white as an angel is the english child but i am black as if bereavd of light  my mother taught me underneath a tree and sitting down before the heat of day she took me on her lap and kissed me and pointing to the east began to say  look on the rising sun there god does live and gives his light and gives his heat away and flowers and trees and beasts and men receive comfort in morning joy in the noonday  and we are put on earth a little space that we may learn to bear the beams of love and these black bodies and this sunburnt face is but a cloud and like a shady grove  for when our souls have learnd the heat to bear the cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice saying come out from the grove my love amp care and round my golden tent like lambs rejoice  thus did my mother say and kissed me and thus i say to little english boy when i from black and he from white cloud free and round the tent of god like lambs we joy  ill shade him from the heat till he can bear to lean in joy upon our fathers knee and then ill stand and stroke his silver hair and be like him and he will then love me
