i amyet what i am none cares or knows my friends forsake me like a memory lost i am the selfconsumer of my woes they rise and vanish in oblivious host like shadows in loves frenzied stifled throes and yet i am and livelike vapours tossed  into the nothingness of scorn and noise into the living sea of waking dreams where there is neither sense of life or joys but the vast shipwreck of my lifes esteems even the dearest that i loved the best are strangenay rather stranger than the rest  i long for scenes where man hath never trod a place where woman never smiled or wept there to abide with my creator god and sleep as i in childhood sweetly slept untroubling and untroubled where i lie the grass belowabove the vaulted sky
