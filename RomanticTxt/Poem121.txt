another yearanother deadly blow another mighty empire overthrown and we are left or shall be left alone the last that dare to struggle with the foe tis well from this day forward we shall know that in ourselves our safety must be sought that by our own right hands it must be wrought that we must stand unpropped or be laid low o dastard whom such foretaste doth not cheer we shall exult if they who rule the land be men who hold its many blessings dear wise upright valiant not a servile band who are to judge of danger which they fear and honour which they do not understand
