i was angry with my friend i told my wrath my wrath did end i was angry with my foe i told it not my wrath did grow  and i waterd it in fears night amp morning with my tears and i sunned it with smiles and with soft deceitful wiles  and it grew both day and night till it bore an apple bright and my foe beheld it shine and he knew that it was mine  and into my garden stole when the night had veild the pole in the morning glad i see my foe outstretched beneath the tree
