what crowding thoughts around me wake what marvels in a christmascake ah say what strange enchantment dwells enclosed within its odorous cells is there no small magician bound encrusted in its snowy round for magic surely lurks in this a cake that tells of vanished bliss a cake that conjures up to view the early scenes when life was new when memory knew no sorrows past and hope believed in joys that last  mysterious cake whose folds contain lifes calendar of bliss and pain that speaks of friends for ever fled and wakes the tears i love to shed oft shall i breathe her cherished name from whose fair hand the offering came for she recalls the artless smile of nymphs that deck my native isle of beauty that we love to trace allied with tender modest grace of those who while abroad they roam retain each charm that gladdens home and whose dear friendships can impart a christmas banquet for the heart
