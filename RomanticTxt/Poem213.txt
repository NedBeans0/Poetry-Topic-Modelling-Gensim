they toil not neither do they spin one morn before me were three figures seen with bowèd necks and joinèd hands sidefaced and one behind the other steppd serene in placid sandals and in white robes graced they passd like figures on a marble urn when shifted round to see the other side they came again as when the urn once more is shifted round the first seen shades return and they were strange to me as may betide with vases to one deep in phidian lore  how is it shadows that i knew ye not how came ye muffled in so hush a mask was it a silent deepdisguisèd plot to steal away and leave without a task my idle days ripe was the drowsy hour the blissful cloud of summerindolence benumbd my eyes my pulse grew less and less pain had no sting and pleasures wreath no flower o why did ye not melt and leave my sense unhaunted quite of all butnothingness  a third time passd they by and passing turnd each one the face a moment whiles to me then faded and to follow them i burnd and ached for wings because i knew the three the first was a fair maid and love her name the second was ambition pale of cheek and ever watchful with fatiguèd eye the last whom i love more the more of blame is heapd upon her maiden most unmeek i knew to be my demon poesy  they faded and forsooth i wanted wings o folly what is love and where is it and for that poor ambition it springs from a mans little hearts short feverfit for poesynoshe has not a joy at least for meso sweet as drowsy noons and evenings steepd in honeyd indolence o for an age so shelterd from annoy that i may never know how change the moons or hear the voice of busy commonsense  and once more came they byalas wherefore my sleep had been embroiderd with dim dreams my soul had been a lawn besprinkled oer with flowers and stirring shades and baffled beams the morn was clouded but no shower fell tho in her lids hung the sweet tears of may the open casement pressd a newleaved vine let in the budding warmth and throstles lay o shadows twas a time to bid farewell upon your skirts had fallen no tears of mine  so ye three ghosts adieu ye cannot raise my head coolbedded in the flowery grass for i would not be dieted with praise a petlamb in a sentimental farce fade softly from my eyes and be once more in masquelike figures on the dreamy urn farewell i yet have visions for the night and for the day faint visions there is store vanish ye phantoms from my idle spright into the clouds and never more return
