i neer was struck before that hour with love so sudden and so sweet her face it bloomed like a sweet flower and stole my heart away complete my face turned pale as deadly pale my legs refused to walk away and when she looked what could i ail my life and all seemed turned to clay  and then my blood rushed to my face and took my eyesight quite away the trees and bushes round the place seemed midnight at noonday i could not see a single thing words from my eyes did start they spoke as chords do from the string and blood burnt round my heart  are flowers the winters choice is loves bed always snow she seemed to hear my silent voice not loves appeals to know i never saw so sweet a face as that i stood before my heart has left its dwellingplace and can return no more
