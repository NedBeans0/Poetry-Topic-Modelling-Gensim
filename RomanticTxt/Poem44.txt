the wild winds weep and the night is acold come hither sleep and my griefs infold but lo the morning peeps over the eastern steeps and the rustling birds of dawn the earth do scorn  lo to the vault of paved heaven with sorrow fraught my notes are driven they strike the ear of night make weep the eyes of day they make mad the roaring winds and with tempests play  like a fiend in a cloud with howling woe after night i do croud and with night will go i turn my back to the east from whence comforts have increasd for light doth seize my brain with frantic pain
