o goddess hear these tuneless numbers wrung by sweet enforcement and remembrance dear and pardon that thy secrets should be sung even into thine own softconched ear surely i dreamt today or did i see the winged psyche with awakend eyes i wanderd in a forest thoughtlessly and on the sudden fainting with surprise saw two fair creatures couched side by side in deepest grass beneath the whispring roof of leaves and trembled blossoms where there ran a brooklet scarce espied  mid hushd coolrooted flowers fragranteyed blue silverwhite and budded tyrian they lay calmbreathing on the bedded grass their arms embraced and their pinions too their lips touchd not but had not bade adieu as if disjoined by softhanded slumber and ready still past kisses to outnumber at tender eyedawn of aurorean love the winged boy i knew but who wast thou o happy happy dove his psyche true  o latest born and loveliest vision far of all olympus faded hierarchy fairer than phoebes sapphireregiond star or vesper amorous glowworm of the sky fairer than these though temple thou hast none nor altar heapd with flowers nor virginchoir to make delicious moan upon the midnight hours no voice no lute no pipe no incense sweet from chainswung censer teeming no shrine no grove no oracle no heat of palemouthd prophet dreaming  o brightest though too late for antique vows too too late for the fond believing lyre when holy were the haunted forest boughs holy the air the water and the fire yet even in these days so far retird from happy pieties thy lucent fans fluttering among the faint olympians i see and sing by my own eyes inspird so let me be thy choir and make a moan upon the midnight hours thy voice thy lute thy pipe thy incense sweet from swinged censer teeming thy shrine thy grove thy oracle thy heat of palemouthd prophet dreaming  yes i will be thy priest and build a fane in some untrodden region of my mind where branched thoughts new grown with pleasant pain instead of pines shall murmur in the wind far far around shall those darkclusterd trees fledge the wildridged mountains steep by steep and there by zephyrs streams and birds and bees the mosslain dryads shall be lulld to sleep and in the midst of this wide quietness a rosy sanctuary will i dress with the wreathd trellis of a working brain with buds and bells and stars without a name with all the gardener fancy eer could feign who breeding flowers will never breed the same and there shall be for thee all soft delight that shadowy thought can win a bright torch and a casement ope at night to let the warm love in
