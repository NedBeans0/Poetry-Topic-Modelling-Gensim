oh come to me in dreams my love i will not ask a dearer bliss come with the starry beams my love and press mine eyelids with thy kiss  twas thus as ancient fables tell love visited a grecian maid till she disturbed the sacred spell and woke to find her hopes betrayed  but gentle sleep shall veil my sight and psyches lamp shall darkling be when in the visions of the night thou dost renew thy vows to me  then come to me in dreams my love i will not ask a dearer bliss come with the starry beams my love and press mine eyelids with thy kiss
