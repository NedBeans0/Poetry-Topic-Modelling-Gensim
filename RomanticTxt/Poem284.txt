from the fireworshippers how sweetly said the trembling maid of her own gentle voice afraid so long had they in silence stood looking upon that tranquil flood how sweetly does the moonbeam smile tonight upon yon leafy isle oft in my fancys wanderings ive wishd that little isle had wings and we within its fairy bowrs were wafted off to seas unknown where not a pulse should beat but ours and we might live love die alone far from the cruel and the cold where the bright eyes of angels only should come around us to behold a paradise so pure and lonely would this be world enough for thee playful she turnd that he might see the passing smile her cheek put on but when she markd how mournfully his eyes met hers that smile was gone and bursting into heartfelt tears yes yes she cried my hourly fears my dreams have boded all too right we partfor ever parttonight i knew i knew it could not last twas bright twas heavnly but tis past oh ever thus from childhoods hour ive seen my fondest hopes decay i never lovd a tree or flowr but twas the first to fade away i never nursd a dear gazelle to glad me with its soft black eye but when it came to know me well and love me it was sure to die now toothe joy most like divine of all i ever dreamt or knew to see thee hear thee call thee mine oh misery must i lose that too yet goon perils brink we meet those frightful rocksthat treachrous sea no never come againthough sweet though heavn it may be death to thee farewelland blessings on thy way whereer thou goest beloved stranger better to sit and watch that ray and think thee safe though far away than have thee near me and in danger
