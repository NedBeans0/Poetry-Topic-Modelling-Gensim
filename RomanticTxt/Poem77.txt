i  the everlasting universe of things flows through the mind and rolls its rapid waves now darknow glitteringnow reflecting gloom now lending splendour where from secret springs the source of human thought its tribute brings of waterswith a sound but half its own such as a feeble brook will oft assume in the wild woods among the mountains lone where waterfalls around it leap for ever where woods and winds contend and a vast river over its rocks ceaselessly bursts and raves  ii  thus thou ravine of arvedark deep ravine thou manycolourd manyvoiced vale over whose pines and crags and caverns sail fast cloudshadows and sunbeams awful scene where power in likeness of the arve comes down from the icegulfs that gird his secret throne bursting through these dark mountains like the flame of lightning through the tempestthou dost lie thy giant brood of pines around thee clinging children of elder time in whose devotion the chainless winds still come and ever came to drink their odours and their mighty swinging to hearan old and solemn harmony thine earthly rainbows stretchd across the sweep of the aethereal waterfall whose veil robes some unsculpturd image the strange sleep which when the voices of the desert fail wraps all in its own deep eternity thy caverns echoing to the arves commotion a loud lone sound no other sound can tame thou art pervaded with that ceaseless motion thou art the path of that unresting sound dizzy ravine and when i gaze on thee i seem as in a trance sublime and strange to muse on my own separate fantasy my own my human mind which passively now renders and receives fast influencings holding an unremitting interchange with the clear universe of things around one legion of wild thoughts whose wandering wings now float above thy darkness and now rest where that or thou art no unbidden guest in the still cave of the witch poesy seeking among the shadows that pass by ghosts of all things that are some shade of thee some phantom some faint image till the breast from which they fled recalls them thou art there  iii  some say that gleams of a remoter world visit the soul in sleep that death is slumber and that its shapes the busy thoughts outnumber of those who wake and livei look on high has some unknown omnipotence unfurld the veil of life and death or do i lie in dream and does the mightier world of sleep spread far around and inaccessibly its circles for the very spirit fails driven like a homeless cloud from steep to steep that vanishes among the viewless gales far far above piercing the infinite sky mont blanc appearsstill snowy and serene its subject mountains their unearthly forms pile around it ice and rock broad vales between of frozen floods unfathomable deeps blue as the overhanging heaven that spread and wind among the accumulated steeps a desert peopled by the storms alone save when the eagle brings some hunters bone and the wolf tracks her therehow hideously its shapes are heapd around rude bare and high ghastly and scarrd and rivenis this the scene where the old earthquakedaemon taught her young ruin were these their toys or did a sea of fire envelop once this silent snow none can replyall seems eternal now the wilderness has a mysterious tongue which teaches awful doubt or faith so mild so solemn so serene that man may be but for such faith with nature reconcild thou hast a voice great mountain to repeal large codes of fraud and woe not understood by all but which the wise and great and good interpret or make felt or deeply feel  iv  the fields the lakes the forests and the streams ocean and all the living things that dwell within the daedal earth lightning and rain earthquake and fiery flood and hurricane the torpor of the year when feeble dreams visit the hidden buds or dreamless sleep holds every future leaf and flower the bound with which from that detested trance they leap the works and ways of man their death and birth and that of him and all that his may be all things that move and breathe with toil and sound are born and die revolve subside and swell power dwells apart in its tranquillity remote serene and inaccessible and this the naked countenance of earth on which i gaze even these primeval mountains teach the adverting mind the glaciers creep like snakes that watch their prey from their far fountains slow rolling on there many a precipice frost and the sun in scorn of mortal power have pild dome pyramid and pinnacle a city of death distinct with many a tower and wall impregnable of beaming ice yet not a city but a flood of ruin is there that from the boundaries of the sky rolls its perpetual stream vast pines are strewing its destind path or in the mangled soil branchless and shatterd stand the rocks drawn down from yon remotest waste have overthrown the limits of the dead and living world never to be reclaimd the dwellingplace of insects beasts and birds becomes its spoil their food and their retreat for ever gone so much of life and joy is lost the race of man flies far in dread his work and dwelling vanish like smoke before the tempests stream and their place is not known below vast caves shine in the rushing torrents restless gleam which from those secret chasms in tumult welling meet in the vale and one majestic river the breath and blood of distant lands for ever rolls its loud waters to the oceanwaves breathes its swift vapours to the circling air  v  mont blanc yet gleams on highthe power is there the still and solemn power of many sights and many sounds and much of life and death in the calm darkness of the moonless nights in the lone glare of day the snows descend upon that mountain none beholds them there nor when the flakes burn in the sinking sun or the starbeams dart through them winds contend silently there and heap the snow with breath rapid and strong but silently its home the voiceless lightning in these solitudes keeps innocently and like vapour broods over the snow the secret strength of things which governs thought and to the infinite dome of heaven is as a law inhabits thee and what were thou and earth and stars and sea if to the human minds imaginings silence and solitude were vacancy
