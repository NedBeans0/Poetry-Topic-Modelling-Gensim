argument  how a ship having passed the line was driven by storms to the cold country towards the south pole and how from thence she made her course to the tropical latitude of the great pacific ocean and of the strange things that befell and in what manner the ancyent marinere came back to his own country part i  it is an ancient mariner and he stoppeth one of three by thy long grey beard and glittering eye now wherefore stoppst thou me  the bridegrooms doors are opened wide and i am next of kin the guests are met the feast is set mayst hear the merry din  he holds him with his skinny hand there was a ship quoth he hold off unhand me greybeard loon eftsoons his hand dropt he  he holds him with his glittering eye the weddingguest stood still and listens like a three years child the mariner hath his will  the weddingguest sat on a stone he cannot choose but hear and thus spake on that ancient man the brighteyed mariner  the ship was cheered the harbour cleared merrily did we drop below the kirk below the hill below the lighthouse top  the sun came up upon the left out of the sea came he and he shone bright and on the right went down into the sea  higher and higher every day till over the mast at noon the weddingguest here beat his breast for he heard the loud bassoon  the bride hath paced into the hall red as a rose is she nodding their heads before her goes the merry minstrelsy  the weddingguest he beat his breast yet he cannot choose but hear and thus spake on that ancient man the brighteyed mariner  and now the stormblast came and he was tyrannous and strong he struck with his oertaking wings and chased us south along  with sloping masts and dipping prow as who pursued with yell and blow still treads the shadow of his foe and forward bends his head the ship drove fast loud roared the blast and southward aye we fled  and now there came both mist and snow and it grew wondrous cold and ice masthigh came floating by as green as emerald  and through the drifts the snowy clifts did send a dismal sheen nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken the ice was all between  the ice was here the ice was there the ice was all around it cracked and growled and roared and howled like noises in a swound  at length did cross an albatross thorough the fog it came as if it had been a christian soul we hailed it in gods name  it ate the food it neer had eat and round and round it flew the ice did split with a thunderfit the helmsman steered us through  and a good south wind sprung up behind the albatross did follow and every day for food or play came to the mariners hollo  in mist or cloud on mast or shroud it perched for vespers nine whiles all the night through fogsmoke white glimmered the white moonshine  god save thee ancient mariner from the fiends that plague thee thus why lookst thou sowith my crossbow i shot the albatross  part ii  the sun now rose upon the right out of the sea came he still hid in mist and on the left went down into the sea  and the good south wind still blew behind but no sweet bird did follow nor any day for food or play came to the mariners hollo  and i had done a hellish thing and it would work em woe for all averred i had killed the bird that made the breeze to blow ah wretch said they the bird to slay that made the breeze to blow  nor dim nor red like gods own head the glorious sun uprist then all averred i had killed the bird that brought the fog and mist twas right said they such birds to slay that bring the fog and mist  the fair breeze blew the white foam flew the furrow followed free we were the first that ever burst into that silent sea  down dropt the breeze the sails dropt down twas sad as sad could be and we did speak only to break the silence of the sea  all in a hot and copper sky the bloody sun at noon right up above the mast did stand no bigger than the moon  day after day day after day we stuck nor breath nor motion as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean  water water every where and all the boards did shrink water water every where nor any drop to drink  the very deep did rot o christ that ever this should be yea slimy things did crawl with legs upon the slimy sea  about about in reel and rout the deathfires danced at night the water like a witchs oils burnt green and blue and white  and some in dreams assurèd were of the spirit that plagued us so nine fathom deep he had followed us from the land of mist and snow  and every tongue through utter drought was withered at the root we could not speak no more than if we had been choked with soot  ah well aday what evil looks had i from old and young instead of the cross the albatross about my neck was hung  part iii  there passed a weary time each throat was parched and glazed each eye a weary time a weary time how glazed each weary eye  when looking westward i beheld a something in the sky  at first it seemed a little speck and then it seemed a mist it moved and moved and took at last a certain shape i wist  a speck a mist a shape i wist and still it neared and neared as if it dodged a watersprite it plunged and tacked and veered  with throats unslaked with black lips baked we could nor laugh nor wail through utter drought all dumb we stood i bit my arm i sucked the blood and cried a sail a sail  with throats unslaked with black lips baked agape they heard me call gramercy they for joy did grin and all at once their breath drew in as they were drinking all  see see i cried she tacks no more hither to work us weal without a breeze without a tide she steadies with upright keel  the western wave was all aflame the day was well nigh done almost upon the western wave rested the broad bright sun when that strange shape drove suddenly betwixt us and the sun  and straight the sun was flecked with bars heavens mother send us grace as if through a dungeongrate he peered with broad and burning face  alas thought i and my heart beat loud how fast she nears and nears are those her sails that glance in the sun like restless gossameres  are those her ribs through which the sun did peer as through a grate and is that woman all her crew is that a death and are there two is death that womans mate  her lips were redher looks were free her locks were yellow as gold her skin was as white as leprosy the nightmare lifeindeath was she who thicks mans blood with cold  the naked hulk alongside came and the twain were casting dice the game is done ive won ive won quoth she and whistles thrice  the suns rim dips the stars rush out at one stride comes the dark with farheard whisper oer the sea off shot the spectrebark  we listened and looked sideways up fear at my heart as at a cup my lifeblood seemed to sip the stars were dim and thick the night the steersmans face by his lamp gleamed white from the sails the dew did drip till clomb above the eastern bar the hornèd moon with one bright star within the nether tip  one after one by the stardogged moon too quick for groan or sigh each turned his face with a ghastly pang and cursed me with his eye  four times fifty living men and i heard nor sigh nor groan with heavy thump a lifeless lump they dropped down one by one  the souls did from their bodies fly they fled to bliss or woe and every soul it passed me by like the whizz of my crossbow  part iv  i fear thee ancient mariner i fear thy skinny hand and thou art long and lank and brown as is the ribbed seasand  i fear thee and thy glittering eye and thy skinny hand so brown fear not fear not thou weddingguest this body dropt not down  alone alone all all alone alone on a wide wide sea and never a saint took pity on my soul in agony  the many men so beautiful and they all dead did lie and a thousand thousand slimy things lived on and so did i  i looked upon the rotting sea and drew my eyes away i looked upon the rotting deck and there the dead men lay  i looked to heaven and tried to pray but or ever a prayer had gusht a wicked whisper came and made my heart as dry as dust  i closed my lids and kept them close and the balls like pulses beat for the sky and the sea and the sea and the sky lay dead like a load on my weary eye and the dead were at my feet  the cold sweat melted from their limbs nor rot nor reek did they the look with which they looked on me had never passed away  an orphans curse would drag to hell a spirit from on high but oh more horrible than that is the curse in a dead mans eye seven days seven nights i saw that curse and yet i could not die  the moving moon went up the sky and no where did abide softly she was going up and a star or two beside  her beams bemocked the sultry main like april hoarfrost spread but where the ships huge shadow lay the charmèd water burnt alway a still and awful red  beyond the shadow of the ship i watched the watersnakes they moved in tracks of shining white and when they reared the elfish light fell off in hoary flakes  within the shadow of the ship i watched their rich attire blue glossy green and velvet black they coiled and swam and every track was a flash of golden fire  o happy living things no tongue their beauty might declare a spring of love gushed from my heart and i blessed them unaware sure my kind saint took pity on me and i blessed them unaware  the selfsame moment i could pray and from my neck so free the albatross fell off and sank like lead into the sea  part v  oh sleep it is a gentle thing beloved from pole to pole to mary queen the praise be given she sent the gentle sleep from heaven that slid into my soul  the silly buckets on the deck that had so long remained i dreamt that they were filled with dew and when i awoke it rained  my lips were wet my throat was cold my garments all were dank sure i had drunken in my dreams and still my body drank  i moved and could not feel my limbs i was so lightalmost i thought that i had died in sleep and was a blessed ghost  and soon i heard a roaring wind it did not come anear but with its sound it shook the sails that were so thin and sere  the upper air burst into life and a hundred fireflags sheen to and fro they were hurried about and to and fro and in and out the wan stars danced between  and the coming wind did roar more loud and the sails did sigh like sedge and the rain poured down from one black cloud the moon was at its edge  the thick black cloud was cleft and still the moon was at its side like waters shot from some high crag the lightning fell with never a jag a river steep and wide  the loud wind never reached the ship yet now the ship moved on beneath the lightning and the moon the dead men gave a groan  they groaned they stirred they all uprose nor spake nor moved their eyes it had been strange even in a dream to have seen those dead men rise  the helmsman steered the ship moved on yet never a breeze upblew the mariners all gan work the ropes where they were wont to do they raised their limbs like lifeless tools we were a ghastly crew  the body of my brothers son stood by me knee to knee the body and i pulled at one rope but he said nought to me  i fear thee ancient mariner be calm thou weddingguest twas not those souls that fled in pain which to their corses came again but a troop of spirits blest  for when it dawnedthey dropped their arms and clustered round the mast sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths and from their bodies passed  around around flew each sweet sound then darted to the sun slowly the sounds came back again now mixed now one by one  sometimes adropping from the sky i heard the skylark sing sometimes all little birds that are how they seemed to fill the sea and air with their sweet jargoning  and now twas like all instruments now like a lonely flute and now it is an angels song that makes the heavens be mute  it ceased yet still the sails made on a pleasant noise till noon a noise like of a hidden brook in the leafy month of june that to the sleeping woods all night singeth a quiet tune  till noon we quietly sailed on yet never a breeze did breathe slowly and smoothly went the ship moved onward from beneath  under the keel nine fathom deep from the land of mist and snow the spirit slid and it was he that made the ship to go the sails at noon left off their tune and the ship stood still also  the sun right up above the mast had fixed her to the ocean but in a minute she gan stir with a short uneasy motion backwards and forwards half her length with a short uneasy motion  then like a pawing horse let go she made a sudden bound it flung the blood into my head and i fell down in a swound  how long in that same fit i lay i have not to declare but ere my living life returned i heard and in my soul discerned two voices in the air  is it he quoth one is this the man by him who died on cross with his cruel bow he laid full low the harmless albatross  the spirit who bideth by himself in the land of mist and snow he loved the bird that loved the man who shot him with his bow  the other was a softer voice as soft as honeydew quoth he the man hath penance done and penance more will do  part vi
