and cheered the ghastly colour from his lips had fled in his deportment shape and mien appeared elysian beauty melancholy grace brought from a pensive though a happy place  he spake of love such love as spirits feel in worlds whose course is equable and pure no fears to beat awayno strife to heal the past unsighed for and the future sure spake of heroic arts in graver mood revived with finer harmony pursued  of all that is most beauteousimaged there in happier beauty more pellucid streams an ampler ether a diviner air and fields invested with purpureal gleams climes which the sun who sheds the brightest day earth knows is all unworthy to survey  yet there the soul shall enter which hath earned that privilege by virtueill said he the end of mans existence i discerned who from ignoble games and revelry could draw when we had parted vain delight while tears were thy best pastime day and night  and while my youthful peers before my eyes each hero following his peculiar bent prepared themselves for glorious enterprise by martial sportsor seated in the tent chieftains and kings in council were detained what time the fleet at aulis lay enchained  the wishedfor wind was giveni then revolved the oracle upon the silent sea and if no worthier led the way resolved that of a thousand vessels mine should be the foremost prow in pressing to the strand mine the first blood
