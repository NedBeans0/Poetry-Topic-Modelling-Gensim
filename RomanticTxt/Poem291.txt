the western waves of ebbing day rolled oer the glen their level way each purple peak each flinty spire was bathed in floods of living fire but not a setting beam could glow within the dark ravines below where twined the path in shadow hid round many a rocky pyramid shooting abruptly from the dell its thundersplintered pinnacle round many an insulated mass the native bulwarks of the pass huge as the tower which builders vain presumptuous piled on shinars plain the rocky summits split and rent formed turret dome or battlement or seemed fantastically set with cupola or minaret wild crests as pagod ever decked or mosque of eastern architect nor were these earthborn castles bare nor lacked they many a banner fair for from their shivered brows displayed far oer the unfathomable glade all twinkling with the dewdrop sheen the brierrose fell in streamers green and creeping shrubs of thousand dyes waved in the westwinds summer sighs  boon nature scattered free and wild each plant or flower the mountains child here eglantine embalmed the air hawthorn and hazel mingled there the primrose pale and violet flower found in each cliff a narrow bower foxglove and nightshade side by side emblems of punishment and pride grouped their dark hues with every stain the weatherbeaten crags retain with boughs that quaked at every breath gray birch and aspen wept beneath aloft the ash and warrior oak cast anchor in the rifted rock and higher yet the pinetree hung his shattered trunk and frequent flung where seemed the cliffs to meet on high his boughs athwart the narrowed sky highest of all where white peaks glanced where glistning streamers waved and danced the wanderers eye could barely view the summer heavens delicious blue so wondrous wild the whole might seem the scenery of a fairy dream  onward amid the copse gan peep a narrow inlet still and deep affording scarce such breadth of brim as served the wild ducks brood to swim lost for a space through thickets veering but broader when again appearing tall rocks and tufted knolls their face could on the darkblue mirror trace and farther as the hunter strayed still broader sweep its channels made the shaggy mounds no longer stood emerging from entangled wood but waveencircled seemed to float like castle girdled with its moat yet broader floods extending still divide them from their parent hill till each retiring claims to be an islet in an inland sea  and now to issue from the glen no pathway meets the wanderers ken unless he climb with footing nice a far projecting precipice the brooms tough roots his ladder made the hazel saplings lent their aid and thus an airy point he won where gleaming with the setting sun one burnished sheet of living gold loch katrine lay beneath him rolled in all her length far winding lay with promontory creek and bay and islands that empurpled bright floated amid the livelier light and mountains that like giants stand to sentinel enchanted land high on the south huge benvenue down to the lake in masses threw crags knolls and mountains confusedly hurled the fragments of an earlier world a wildering forest feathered oer his ruined sides and summit hoar while on the north through middle air benan heaved high his forehead bare
