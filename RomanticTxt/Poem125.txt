the child is father of the man and i could wish my days to be bound each to each by natural piety wordsworth my heart leaps up there was a time when meadow grove and stream the earth and every common sight to me did seem apparelled in celestial light the glory and the freshness of a dream it is not now as it hath been of yore turn wheresoeer i may by night or day the things which i have seen i now can see no more  the rainbow comes and goes and lovely is the rose the moon doth with delight look round her when the heavens are bare waters on a starry night are beautiful and fair the sunshine is a glorious birth but yet i know whereer i go that there hath past away a glory from the earth  now while the birds thus sing a joyous song and while the young lambs bound as to the tabors sound to me alone there came a thought of grief a timely utterance gave that thought relief and i again am strong the cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep no more shall grief of mine the season wrong i hear the echoes through the mountains throng the winds come to me from the fields of sleep and all the earth is gay land and sea give themselves up to jollity and with the heart of may doth every beast keep holiday thou child of joy shout round me let me hear thy shouts thou happy shepherdboy  ye bless√®d creatures i have heard the call ye to each other make i see the heavens laugh with you in your jubilee my heart is at your festival my head hath its coronal the fulness of your bliss i feeli feel it all oh evil day if i were sullen while earth herself is adorning this sweet maymorning and the children are culling on every side in a thousand valleys far and wide fresh flowers while the sun shines warm and the babe leaps up on his mothers arm i hear i hear with joy i hear but theres a tree of many one a single field which i have looked upon both of them speak of something that is gone the pansy at my feet doth the same tale repeat whither is fled the visionary gleam where is it now the glory and the dream  our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting the soul that rises with us our lifes star hath had elsewhere its setting and cometh from afar not in entire forgetfulness and not in utter nakedness but trailing clouds of glory do we come from god who is our home heaven lies about us in our infancy shades of the prisonhouse begin to close upon the growing boy but he beholds the light and whence it flows he sees it in his joy the youth who daily farther from the east must travel still is natures priest and by the vision splendid is on his way attended at length the man perceives it die away and fade into the light of common day  earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own yearnings she hath in her own natural kind and even with something of a mothers mind and no unworthy aim the homely nurse doth all she can to make her fosterchild her inmate man forget the glories he hath known and that imperial palace whence he came  behold the child among his newborn blisses a six years darling of a pigmy size see where mid work of his own hand he lies fretted by sallies of his mothers kisses with light upon him from his fathers eyes see at his feet some little plan or chart some fragment from his dream of human life shaped by himself with newlylearned art a wedding or a festival a mourning or a funeral and this hath now his heart and unto this he frames his song then will he fit his tongue to dialogues of business love or strife but it will not be long ere this be thrown aside and with new joy and pride the little actor cons another part filling from time to time his humorous stage with all the persons down to palsied age that life brings with her in her equipage as if his whole vocation were endless imitation  thou whose exterior semblance doth belie thy souls immensity thou best philosopher who yet dost keep thy heritage thou eye among the blind that deaf and silent readst the eternal deep haunted for ever by the eternal mind mighty prophet seer blest on whom those truths do rest which we are toiling all our lives to find in darkness lost the darkness of the grave thou over whom thy immortality broods like the day a master oer a slave a presence which is not to be put by thou little child yet glorious in the might of heavenborn freedom on thy beings height why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke the years to bring the inevitable yoke thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight and custom lie upon thee with a weight heavy as frost and deep almost as life  o joy that in our embers is something that doth live that nature yet remembers what was so fugitive the thought of our past years in me doth breed perpetual benediction not indeed for that which is most worthy to be blest delight and liberty the simple creed of childhood whether busy or at rest with newfledged hope still fluttering in his breast not for these i raise the song of thanks and praise but for those obstinate questionings of sense and outward things fallings from us vanishings blank misgivings of a creature moving about in worlds not realised high instincts before which our mortal nature did tremble like a guilty thing surprised but for those first affections those shadowy recollections which be they what they may are yet the fountainlight of all our day are yet a masterlight of all our seeing uphold us cherish and have power to make our noisy years seem moments in the being of the eternal silence truths that wake to perish never which neither listlessness nor mad endeavour nor man nor boy nor all that is at enmity with joy can utterly abolish or destroy hence in a season of calm weather though inland far we be our souls have sight of that immortal sea which brought us hither can in a moment travel thither and see the children sport upon the shore and hear the mighty waters rolling evermore  then sing ye birds sing sing a joyous song and let the young lambs bound as to the tabors sound we in thought will join your throng ye that pipe and ye that play ye that through your hearts today feel the gladness of the may what though the radiance which was once so bright be now for ever taken from my sight though nothing can bring back the hour of splendour in the grass of glory in the flower we will grieve not rather find strength in what remains behind in the primal sympathy which having been must ever be in the soothing thoughts that spring out of human suffering in the faith that looks through death in years that bring the philosophic mind and o ye fountains meadows hills and groves forebode not any severing of our loves yet in my heart of hearts i feel your might i only have relinquished one delight to live beneath your more habitual sway i love the brooks which down their channels fret even more than when i tripped lightly as they the innocent brightness of a newborn day is lovely yet the clouds that gather round the setting sun do take a sober colouring from an eye that hath kept watch oer mans mortality another race hath been and other palms are won thanks to the human heart by which we live thanks to its tenderness its joys and fears to me the meanest flower that blows can give thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears
