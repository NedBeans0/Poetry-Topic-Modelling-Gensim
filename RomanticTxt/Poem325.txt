forgive me if i wound your ear by calling of you nancy which is the name of my sweet friend the others but her fancy  ah dearest girl how could your mind the strange distinction frame the whimsical unjust caprice which robs you of your name  nancy agrees with what we see a being wild and airy gay as a nymph of floras train fantastic as a fairy  but annas of a different kind a melancholy maid boasting a sentimental soul in solemn pomp arrayed  oh neer will i forsake the sound so artless and so free be what you will with all mankind but nancy still with me
