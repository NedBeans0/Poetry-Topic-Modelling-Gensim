thus far o friend have we though leaving much unvisited endeavourd to retrace my life through its first years and measured back the way i travelld when i first began to love the woods and fields the passion yet was in its birth sustaind as might befal by nourishment that came unsought for still from week to week from month to month we livd a round of tumult duly were our games prolongd in summer till the daylight faild no chair remaind before the doors the bench and threshold steps were empty fast asleep the labourer and the old man who had sate a later lingerer yet the revelry continued and the loud uproar at last when all the ground was dark and the huge clouds were edged with twinkling stars to bed we went with weary joints and with a beating mind ah is there one who ever has been young nor needs a monitory voice to tame the pride of virtue and of intellect and is there one the wisest and the best of all mankind who does not sometimes wish for things which cannot be who would not give if so he might to duty and to truth the eagerness of infantine desire a tranquillizing spirit presses now on my corporeal frame so wide appears the vacancy between me and those days which yet have such selfpresence in my mind that sometimes when i think of them i seem two consciousnesses conscious of myself and of some other being a grey stone of native rock left midway in the square of our small market village was the home and centre of these joys and when returnd after long absence thither i repaird i found that it was split and gone to build a smart assemblyroom that perkd and flard with wash and roughcast elbowing the ground which had been ours but let the fiddle scream and be ye happy yet my friends i know that more than one of you will think with me of those soft starry nights and that old dame from whom the stone was namd who there had sate and watchd her table with its hucksters wares assiduous thro the length of sixty years  we ran a boisterous race the year span round with giddy motion but the time approachd that brought with it a regular desire for calmer pleasures when the beauteous forms of nature were collaterally attachd to every scheme of holiday delight and every boyish sport less grateful else and languidly pursued  when summer came it was the pastime of our afternoons to beat along the plain of windermere with rival oars and the selected bourne was now an island musical with birds that sang for ever now a sister isle beneath the oaks umbrageous covert sown with lillies of the valley like a field and now a third small island where remaind an old stone table and a moulderd cave a hermits history in such a race so ended disappointment could be none uneasiness or pain or jealousy we rested in the shade all pleasd alike conquerd and conqueror thus the pride of strength and the vainglory of superior skill were interfusd with objects which subdud and temperd them and gradually producd a quiet independence of the heart and to my friend who knows me i may add unapprehensive of reproof that hence ensud a diffidence and modesty and i was taught to feel perhaps too much the selfsufficing power of solitude  no delicate viands sappd our bodily strength more than we wishd we knew the blessing then of vigorous hunger for our daily meals were frugal sabine fare and then exclude a little weekly stipend and we lived through three divisions of the quarterd year in pennyless poverty but now to school returnd from the halfyearly holidays we came with purses more profusely filld allowance which abundantly sufficd to gratify the palate with repasts more costly than the dame of whom i spake that ancient woman and her board supplied hence inroads into distant vales and long excursions far away among the hills hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground or in the woods or near a river side or by some shady fountain while soft airs among the leaves were stirring and the sun unfelt shone sweetly round us in our joy  nor is my aim neglected if i tell how twice in the long length of those halfyears we from our funds perhaps with bolder hand drew largely anxious for one day at least to feel the motion of the galloping steed and with the good old innkeeper in truth on such occasion sometimes we employd sly subterfuge for the intended bound of the days journey was too distant far for any cautious man a structure famed beyond its neighbourhood the antique walls of that large abbey which within the vale of nightshade to st marys honour built stands yet a mouldering pile with fractured arch belfry and images and living trees a holy scene along the smooth green turf our horses grazed to more than inland peace left by the sea wind passing overhead though wind of roughest temper trees and towers may in that valley oftentimes be seen both silent and both motionless alike such is the shelter that is there and such the safeguard for repose and quietness  our steeds remounted and the summons given with whip and spur we by the chauntry flew in uncouth race and left the crossleggd knight and the stoneabbot and that single wren which one day sang so sweetly in the nave of the old church that though from recent showers the earth was comfortless and touchd by faint internal breezes sobbings of the place and respirations from the roofless walls the shuddering ivy drippd large drops yet still so sweetly mid the gloom the invisible bird sang to itself that there i could have made my dwellingplace and livd for ever there to hear such music through the walls we flew and down the valley and a circuit made in wantonness of heart through rough and smooth we scamperd homeward oh ye rocks and streams and that still spirit of the evening air even in this joyous time i sometimes felt your presence when with slackend step we breathd along the sides of the steep hills or when lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea we beat with thundering hoofs the level sand  upon the eastern shore of windermere above the crescent of a pleasant bay there stood an inn no homelyfeatured shed brother of the surrounding cottages but twas a splendid place the door beset with chaises grooms and liveries and within decanters glasses and the bloodred wine in ancient times or ere the hall was built on the large island had this dwelling been more worthy of a poets love a hut proud of its one bright fire and sycamore shade but though the rhymes were gone which once inscribed the threshold and large golden characters on the bluefrosted signboard had usurpd the place of the old lion in contempt and mockery of the rustic painters hand yet to this hour the spot to me is dear with all its foolish pomp the garden lay upon a slope surmounted by the plain of a small bowlinggreen beneath us stood a grove with gleams of water through the trees and over the treetops nor did we want refreshment strawberries and mellow cream and there through half an afternoon we playd on the smooth platform and the shouts we sent made all the mountains ring but ere the fall of night when in our pinnace we returnd over the dusky lake and to the beach of some small island steerd our course with one the minstrel of our troop and left him there and rowd off gently while he blew his flute alone upon the rock oh then the calm and dead still water lay upon my mind even with a weight of pleasure and the sky never before so beautiful sank down into my heart and held me like a dream  thus daily were my sympathies enlarged and thus the common range of visible things grew dear to me already i began to love the sun a boy i lovd the sun not as i since have lovd him as a pledge and surety of our earthly life a light which while we view we feel we are alive but for this cause that i had seen him lay his beauty on the morning hills had seen the western mountain touch his setting orb in many a thoughtless hour when from excess of happiness my blood appeard to flow with its own pleasure and i breathd with joy and from like feelings humble though intense to patriotic and domestic love analogous the moon to me was dear for i would dream away my purposes standing to look upon her while she hung midway between the hills as if she knew no other region but belongd to thee yea appertaind by a peculiar right to thee and thy grey huts my darling vale  those incidental charms which first attachd my heart to rural objects day by day grew weaker and i hasten on to tell how nature intervenient till this time and secondary now at length was sought for her own sake but who shall parcel out his intellect by geometric rules split like a province into round and square who knows the individual hour in which his habits were first sown even as a seed who that shall point as with a wand and say this portion of the river of my mind came from yon fountain thou my friend art one more deeply read in thy own thoughts to thee science appears but what in truth she is not as our glory and our absolute boast but as a succedaneum and a prop to our infirmity thou art no slave of that false secondary power by which in weakness we create distinctions then deem that our puny boundaries are things which we perceive and not which we have made to thee unblinded by these outward shows the unity of all has been reveald and thou wilt doubt with me less aptly skilld than many are to class the cabinet of their sensations and in voluble phrase run through the history and birth of each as of a single independent thing hard task to analyse a soul in which not only general habits and desires but each most obvious and particular thought not in a mystical and idle sense but in the words of reason deeply weighd hath no beginning  blessd the infant babe for with my best conjectures i would trace the progress of our being blest the babe nursd in his mothers arms the babe who sleeps upon his mothers breast who when his soul claims manifest kindred with an earthly soul doth gather passion from his mothers eye such feelings pass into his torpid life like an awakening breeze and hence his mind even in the first trial of its powers is prompt and watchful eager to combine in one appearance all the elements and parts of the same object else detachd and loth to coalesce thus day by day subjected to the discipline of love his organs and recipient faculties are quickend are more vigorous his mind spreads tenacious of the forms which it receives in one beloved presence nay and more in that most apprehensive habitude and those sensations which have been derivd from this beloved presence there exists a virtue which irradiates and exalts all objects through all intercourse of sense no outcast he bewilderd and depressd along his infant veins are interfusd the gravitation and the filial bond of nature that connect him with the world emphatically such a being lives an inmate of this active universe from nature largely he receives nor so is satisfied but largely gives again for feeling has to him imparted strength and powerful in all sentiments of grief of exultation fear and joy his mind even as an agent of the one great mind creates creator and receiver both working but in alliance with the works which it beholdssuch verily is the first poetic spirit of our human life by uniform control of after years in most abated or suppressd in some through every change of growth or of decay preeminent till death  from early days beginning not long after that first time in which a babe by intercourse of touch i held mute dialogues with my mothers heart i have endeavourd to display the means whereby this infant sensibility great birthright of our being was in me augmented and sustaind yet is a path more difficult before me and i fear that in its broken windings we shall need the chamois sinews and the eagles wing for now a trouble came into my mind from unknown causes i was left alone seeking the visible world nor knowing why the props of my affections were removd and yet the building stood as if sustaind by its own spirit all that i beheld was dear to me and from this cause it came that now to natures finer influxes my mind lay open to that more exact and intimate communion which our hearts maintain with the minuter properties of objects which already are belovd and of those only many are the joys of youth but oh what happiness to live when every hour brings palpable access of knowledge when all knowledge is delight and sorrow is not there the seasons came and every season to my notice brought a store of transitory qualities which but for this most watchful power of love had been neglected left a register of permanent relations else unknown hence life and change and beauty solitude more active even than best society society made sweet as solitude by silent inobtrusive sympathies and gentle agitations of the mind from manifold distinctions difference perceived in things where to the common eye no difference is and hence from the same source sublimer joy for i would walk alone in storm and tempest or in starlight nights beneath the quiet heavens and at that time have felt whateer there is of power in sound to breathe an elevated mood by form or image unprofaned and i would stand beneath some rock listening to sounds that are the ghostly language of the ancient earth or make their dim abode in distant winds thence did i drink the visionary power i deem not profitless those fleeting moods of shadowy exultation not for this that they are kindred to our purer mind and intellectual life but that the soul remembering how she felt but what she felt remembering not retains an obscure sense of possible sublimity to which with growing faculties she doth aspire with faculties still growing feeling still that whatsoever point they gain they still have something to pursue  and not alone in grandeur and in tumult but no less in tranquil scenes that universal power and fitness in the latent qualities and essences of things by which the mind is movd by feelings of delight to me came strengthend with a superadded soul a virtue not its own my morning walks were early oft before the hours of school i travelld round our little lake five miles of pleasant wandering happy time more dear for this that one was by my side a friend then passionately lovd with heart how full will he peruse these lines this page perhaps a blank to other men for many years have since flowd in between us and our minds both silent to each other at this time we live as if those hours had never been nor seldom did i lift our cottage latch far earlier and before the vernal thrush was audible among the hills i sate alone upon some jutting eminence at the first hour of morning when the vale lay quiet in an utter solitude how shall i trace the history where seek the origin of what i then have felt oft in these moments such a holy calm did overspread my soul that i forgot that i had bodily eyes and what i saw appeard like something in myself a dream a prospect in my mind  twere long to tell what spring and autumn what the winter snows and what the summer shade what day and night the evening and the morning what my dreams and what my waking thoughts supplied to nurse that spirit of religious love in which i walked with nature but let this at least be not forgotten that i still retaind my first creative sensibility that by the regular action of the world my soul was unsubdud a plastic power abode with me a forming hand at times rebellious acting in a devious mood a local spirit of its own at war with general tendency but for the most subservient strictly to the external things with which it commund an auxiliar light came from my mind which on the setting sun bestowd new splendor the melodious birds the gentle breezes fountains that ran on murmuring so sweetly in themselves obeyd a like dominion and the midnight storm grew darker in the presence of my eye hence by obeisance my devotion hence and hence my transport  nor should this perchance pass unrecorded that i still have lovd the exercise and produce of a toil than analytic industry to me more pleasing and whose character i deem is more poetic as resembling more creative agency i mean to speak of that interminable building reard by observation of affinities in objects where no brotherhood exists to common minds my seventeenth year was come and whether from this habit rooted now so deeply in my mind or from excess of the great social principle of life coercing all things into sympathy to unorganic natures i transferrd my own enjoyments or the power of truth coming in revelation i conversd with things that really are i at this time saw blessings spread around me like a sea thus did my days pass on and now at length from nature and her overflowing soul i had receivd so much that all my thoughts were steepd in feeling i was only then contented when with bliss ineffable i felt the sentiment of being spread oer all that moves and all that seemeth still oer all that lost beyond the reach of thought and human knowledge to the human eye invisible yet liveth to the heart oer all that leaps and runs and shouts and sings or beats the gladsome air oer all that glides beneath the wave yea in the wave itself and mighty depth of waters wonder not if such my transports were for in all things i saw one life and felt that it was joy one song they sang and it was audible most audible then when the fleshly ear oercome by grosser prelude of that strain forgot its functions and slept undisturbd  if this be error and another faith find easier access to the pious mind yet were i grossly destitute of all those human sentiments which make this earth so dear if i should fail with grateful voice to speak of you ye mountains and ye lakes and sounding cataracts ye mists and winds that dwell among the hills where i was born if in my youth i have been pure in heart if mingling with the world i am content with my own modest pleasures and have livd with god and nature communing removd from little enmities and low desires the gift is yours if in these times of fear this melancholy waste of hopes oerthrown if mid indifference and apathy and wicked exultation when good men on every side fall off we know not how to selfishness disguisd in gentle names of peace and quiet and domestic love yet mingled not unwillingly with sneers on visionary minds if in this time of dereliction and dismay i yet despair not of our nature but retain a more than roman confidence a faith that fails not in all sorrow my support the blessing of my life the gift is yours ye mountains thine o nature thou hast fed my lofty speculations and in thee for this uneasy heart of ours i find a neverfailing principle of joy and purest passion  thou my friend wert reard in the great city mid far other scenes but we by different roads at length have gaind the selfsame bourne and for this cause to thee i speak unapprehensive of contempt the insinuated scoff of coward tongues and all that silent language which so oft in conversation betwixt man and man blots from the human countenance all trace of beauty and of love for thou hast sought the truth in solitude and thou art one the most intense of natures worshippers in many things my brother chiefly here in this my deep devotion  fare thee well health and the quiet of a healthful mind attend thee seeking oft the haunts of men and yet more often living with thyself and for thyself so haply shall thy days be many and a blessing to mankind
