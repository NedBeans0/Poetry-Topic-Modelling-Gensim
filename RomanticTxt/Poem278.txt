i have had playmates i have had companions in my days of childhood in my joyful schooldays all all are gone the old familiar faces  i have been laughing i have been carousing drinking late sitting late with my bosom cronies all all are gone the old familiar faces  i loved a love once fairest among women closed are her doors on me i must not see her  all all are gone the old familiar faces  i have a friend a kinder friend has no man like an ingrate i left my friend abruptly left him to muse on the old familiar faces  ghostlike i paced round the haunts of my childhood earth seemed a desert i was bound to traverse seeking to find the old familiar faces  friend of my bosom thou more than a brother why wert not thou born in my fathers dwelling so might we talk of the old familiar faces   how some they have died and some they have left me and some are taken from me all are departed all all are gone the old familiar faces
