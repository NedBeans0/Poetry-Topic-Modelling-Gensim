now spring appears with beauty crowned and all is light and life around why comes not jane when friendship calls why leaves she not augustas walls where cooling zephyrs faintly blow nor spread the cheering healthful glow that glides through each awakened vein as skimming oer the spacious plain we look around with joyous eye and view no boundaries but the sky  already aprils reign is oer her evening tints delight no more no more the violet scents the gale no more the mist oerspreads the vale the lovely queen of smiles and tears who gave thee birth no more appears but blushing may with brow serene and vestments of a livelier green commands the winged choir to sing and with wild notes the meadows ring  o come ere all the train is gone no more to hail thy twentyone that age which higher honour shares and well become the wreath it wears from lassitude and cities flee and breathe the air of heaven with me
