hear the voice of the bard who present past amp future sees whose ears have heard the holy word that walkd among the ancient trees  calling the lapsed soul and weeping in the evening dew that might controll the starry pole and fallen fallen light renew  o earth o earth return arise from out the dewy grass night is worn and the morn rises from the slumberous mass  turn away no more why wilt thou turn away the starry floor the watry shore is givn thee till the break of day
