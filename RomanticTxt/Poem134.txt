at the corner of wood street when daylight appears hangs a thrush that sings loud it has sung for three years poor susan has passed by the spot and has heard in the silence of morning the song of the bird  tis a note of enchantment what ails her she sees a mountain ascending a vision of trees bright volumes of vapour through lothbury glide and a river flows on through the vale of cheapside  green pastures she views in the midst of the dale down which she so often has tripped with her pail and a single small cottage a nest like a doves the one only dwelling on earth that she loves  she looks and her heart is in heaven but they fade the mist and the river the hill and the shade the stream will not flow and the hill will not rise and the colours have all passed away from her eyes
