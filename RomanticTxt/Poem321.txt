ay gaze upon her rosewreathed hair and gaze upon her smile seem as you drank the very air her breath perfumed the while  and wake for her the gifted line that wild and witching lay and swear your heart is as a shrine that only owns her sway  tis well i am revenged at last mark you that scornful cheek the eye averted as you passd spoke more than words could speak  ay now by all the bitter tears that i have shed for thee the racking doubts the burning fears avenged they well may be  by the nights passd in sleepless care the days of endless woe all that you taught my heart to bear all that yourself will know  i would not wish to see you laid within an early tomb i should forget how you betrayd and only weep your doom  but this is fitting punishment to live and love in vain oh my wrung heart be thou content and feed upon his pain  go thou and watch her lightest sigh thine own it will not be and bask beneath her sunny eye it will not turn on thee  tis well the rack the chain the wheel far better hadst thou proved evn i could almost pity feel for thou art nor beloved
