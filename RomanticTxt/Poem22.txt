a little black thing among the snow crying weep weep in notes of woe where are thy father and mother say they are both gone up to the church to pray  because i was happy upon the heath and smild among the winters snow they clothed me in the clothes of death and taught me to sing the notes of woe  and because i am happy and dance and sing they think they have done me no injury and are gone to praise god and his priest and king who make up a heaven of our misery
