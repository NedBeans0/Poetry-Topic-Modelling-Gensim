and is thisyarrowthis the stream of which my fancy cherished so faithfully a waking dream an image that hath perished o that some minstrels harp were near to utter notes of gladness and chase this silence from the air that fills my heart with sadness  yet whya silvery current flows with uncontrolled meanderings nor have these eyes by greener hills been soothed in all my wanderings and through her depths saint marys lake is visibly delighted for not a feature of those hills is in the mirror slighted  a blue sky bends oer yarrow vale save where that pearly whiteness is round the rising sun diffused a tender hazy brightness mild dawn of promise that excludes all profitless dejection though not unwilling here to admit a pensive recollection  where was it that the famous flower of yarrow vale lay bleeding his bed perchance was yon smooth mound on which the herd is feeding and haply from this crystal pool now peaceful as the morning the waterwraith ascended thrice and gave his doleful warning  delicious is the lay that sings the haunts of happy lovers the path that leads them to the grove the leafy grove that covers and pity sanctifies the verse that paints by strength of sorrow the unconquerable strength of love bear witness rueful yarrow  but thou that didst appear so fair to fond imagination dost rival in the light of day her delicate creation meek loveliness is round thee spread a softness still and holy the grace of forest charms decayed and pastoral melancholy  that region left the vale unfolds rich groves of lofty stature with yarrow winding through the pomp of cultivated nature and rising from those lofty groves behold a ruin hoary the shattered front of newarks towers renowned in border story  fair scenes for childhoods opening bloom for sportive youth to stray in for manhood to enjoy his strength and age to wear away in yon cottage seems a bower of bliss a covert for protection of tender thoughts that nestle there the brood of chaste affection  how sweet on this autumnal day the wildwood fruits to gather and on my trueloves forehead plant a crest of blooming heather and what if i enwreathed my own twere no offence to reason the sober hills thus deck their brows to meet the wintry season  i seebut not by sight alone loved yarrow have i won thee a ray of fancy still survives her sunshine plays upon thee thy everyouthful waters keep a course of lively pleasure and gladsome notes my lips can breathe accordant to the measure  the vapours linger round the heights they melt and soon must vanish one hour is theirs nor more is mine sad thought which i would banish but that i know whereer i go thy genuine image yarrow will dwell with meto heighten joy and cheer my mind in sorrow
