thels motto  does the eagle know what is in the pit or wilt thou go ask the mole can wisdom be put in a silver rod or love in a golden bowl i  the daughters of mne seraphim led round their sunny flocks all but the youngest she in paleness sought the secret air to fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day down by the river of adona her soft voice is heard and thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew  o life of this our spring why fades the lotus of the water why fade these children of the spring born but to smile amp fall ah thel is like a watry bow and like a parting cloud like a reflection in a glass like shadows in the water like dreams of infants like a smile upon an infants face like the doves voice like transient day like music in the air ah gentle may i lay me down and gentle rest my head and gentle sleep the sleep of death and gentle hear the voice of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time  the lilly of the valley breathing in the humble grass answerd the lovely maid and said i am a watry weed and i am very small and love to dwell in lowly vales so weak the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head yet i am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all walks in the valley and each morn over me spreads his hand saying rejoice thou humble grass thou newborn lilly flower thou gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest brooks for thou shalt be clothed in light and fed with morning manna till summers heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs to flourish in eternal vales then why should thel complain  why should the mistress of the vales of har utter a sigh  she ceasd amp smild in tears then sat down in her silver shrine  thel answered o thou little virgin of the peaceful valley giving to those that cannot crave the voiceless the oertired thy breath doth nourish the innocent lamb he smells thy milky garments he crops thy flowers while thou sittest smiling in his face wiping his mild and meekin mouth from all contagious taints thy wine doth purify the golden honey thy perfume which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs revives the milked cow amp tames the firebreathing steed but thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun i vanish from my pearly throne and who shall find my place  queen of the vales the lily answered ask the tender cloud and it shall tell thee why it glitters in the morning sky and why it scatters its bright beauty thro the humid air descend o little cloud amp hover before the eyes of thel  the cloud descended and the lily bowd her modest head and went to mind her numerous charge among the verdant grass  ii  o little cloud the virgin said i charge thee tell to me why thou complainest not when in one hour thou fade away then we shall seek thee but not find ah thel is like to thee i pass away yet i complain and no one hears my voice  the cloud then shewd his golden head amp his bright form emergd hovering and glittering on the air before the face of thel  o virgin knowst thou not our steeds drink of the golden springs where luvah doth renew his horses lookst thou on my youth and fearest thou because i vanish and am seen no more nothing remains o maid i tell thee when i pass away it is to tenfold life to love to peace and raptures holy unseen descending weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers and court the fair eyed dew to take me to her shining tent the weeping virgin trembling kneels before the risen sun till we arise linkd in a golden band and never part but walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers  dost thou o little cloud i fear that i am not like thee for i walk through the vales of har and smell the sweetest flowers but i feed not the little flowers i hear the warbling birds but i feed not the warbling birds they fly and seek their food but thel delights in these no more because i fade away and all shall say without a use this shining woman livd or did she only live to be at death the food of worms  the cloud reclind upon his airy throne and answerd thus  then if thou art the food of worms o virgin of the skies how great thy use how great thy blessing every thing that lives lives not alone nor for itself fear not and i will call the weak worm from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear its voice come forth worm of the silent valley to thy pensive queen  the helpless worm arose and sat upon the lilys leaf and the bright cloud saild on to find his partner in the vale  iii  then thel astonishd viewd the worm upon its dewy bed  art thou a worm image of weakness art thou but a worm i see thee like an infant wrapped in the lilys leaf ah weep not little voice thou canst not speak but thou canst weep is this a worm i see thee lay helpless amp naked weeping and none to answer none to cherish thee with mothers smiles  the clod of clay heard the worms voice amp raisd her pitying head she bowd over the weeping infant and her life exhald in milky fondness then on thel she fixd her humble eyes  o beauty of the vales of har we live not for ourselves thou seest me the meanest thing and so i am indeed my bosom of itself is cold and of itself is dark  but he that loves the lowly pours his oil upon my head and kisses me and binds his nuptial bands around my breast and says thou mother of my children i have loved thee and i have given thee a crown that none can take away but how this is sweet maid i know not and i cannot know i ponder and i cannot ponder yet i live and love  the daughter of beauty wipd her pitying tears with her white veil and said alas i knew not this and therefore did i weep that god would love a worm i knew and punish the evil foot that wilful bruisd its helpless form but that he cherishd it with milk and oil i never knew and therefore did i weep and i complaind in the mild air because i fade away and lay me down in thy cold bed and leave my shining lot  queen of the vales the matron clay answered i heard thy sighs and all thy moans flew oer my roof but i have calld them down wilt thou o queen enter my house tis given thee to enter and to return fear nothing enter with thy virgin feet  iv  the eternal gates terrific porter lifted the northern bar thel enterd in amp saw the secrets of the land unknown she saw the couches of the dead amp where the fibrous roots of every heart on earth infixes deep its restless twists a land of sorrows amp of tears where never smile was seen  she wanderd in the land of clouds thro valleys dark listning dolours amp lamentations waiting oft beside a dewy grave she stood in silence listning to the voices of the ground till to her own grave plot she came amp there she sat down and heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit  why cannot the ear be closed to its own destruction or the glistning eye to the poison of a smile why are eyelids stord with arrows ready drawn where a thousand fighting men in ambush lie or an eye of gifts amp graces showring fruits and coined gold why a tongue impressd with honey from every wind why an ear a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in why a nostril wide inhaling terror trembling and affright why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire  the virgin started from her seat amp with a shriek fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of har
