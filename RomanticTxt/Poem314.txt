the village life and every care that reigns oer youthful peasants and declining swains what labour yields and what that labour past age in its hour of languor finds at last what forms the real picture of the poor demands a songthe muse can give no more fled are those times if eer such times were seen when rustic poets praised their native green no shepherds now in smooth alternate verse their countrys beauty or their nymphs rehearse yet still for these we frame the tender strain still in our lays fond corydons complain and shepherds boys their amorous pains reveal the only pains alas they never feel on mincios banks in caesars bounteous reign if tityrus found the golden age again must sleepy bards the flattering dream prolong mechanic echoes of the mantuan song from truth and nature shall we widely stray where virgil not where fancy leads the way yes thus the muses sing of happy swains because the muses never knew their pains they boast their peasants pipes but peasants now resign their pipes and plod behind the plough and few amid the rural tribe have time to number syllables and play with rhyme save honest duck what son of verse could share the poets rapture and the peasants care or the great labours of the field degrade with the new peril of a poorer trade from one chief cause these idle praises spring that themes so easy few forbear to sing they ask no thought require no deep design but swell the song and liquefy the line the gentle lover takes the rural strain a nymph his mistress and himself a swain with no sad scenes he clouds his tuneful prayer but all to look like her is painted fair i grant indeed that fields and flocks have charms for him that gazes or for him that farms but when amid such pleasing scenes i trace the poor laborious natives of the place and see the midday sun with fervid ray on their bare heads and dewy temples play while some with feebler heads and fainter hearts deplore their fortune yet sustain their parts then shall i dare these real ills to hide in tinsel trappings of poetic pride no cast by fortune on a frowning coast which can no groves nor happy valleys boast where other cares than those the muse relates and other shepherds dwell with other mates by such examples taught i paint the cot as truth will paint it and as bards will not nor you ye poor of lettered scorn complain to you the smoothest song is smooth in vain oercome by labour and bowed down by time feel you the barren flattery of a rhyme can poets soothe you when you pine for bread by winding myrtles round your ruined shed can their light tales your weighty griefs oerpower or glad with airy mirth the toilsome hour lo where the heath with withering brake grown oer lends the light turf that warms the neighboring poor from thence a length of burning sand appears where the thin harvest waves its withered ears rank weeds that every art and care defy reign oer the land and rob the blighted rye there thistles stretch their prickly arms afar and to the ragged infant threaten war there poppies nodding mock the hope of toil there the blue bugloss paints the sterile soil hardy and high above the slender sheaf the slimy mallow waves her silky leaf oer the young shoot the charlock throws a shade and the wild tare clings round the sickly blade with mingled tints the rocky coasts abound and a sad splendor vainly shines around so looks the nymph whom wretched arts adorn betrayed by man then left for man to scorn whose cheek in vain assumes the mimic rose while her sad eyes the troubled breast disclose whose outward splendour is but follys dress exposing most when most it gilds distress here joyless roam a wild amphibious race with sullen woe displayed in every face who far from civil arts and social fly and scowl at strangers with suspicious eye here too the lawless merchant of the main draws from his plough th intoxicated swain want only claimed the labor of the day but vice now steals his nightly rest away where are the swains who daily labor done with rural games played down the setting sun who struck with matchless force the bounding ball or made the pondrous quoit obliquely fall while some huge ajax terrible and strong engaged some artful stripling of the throng and foiled beneath the young ulysses fell when peals of praise the merry mischief tell where now are thesebeneath yon cliff they stand to show the freighted pinnace where to land to load the ready steed with guilty haste to fly in terror oer the pathless waste or when detected in their straggling course to foil their foes by cunning or by force or yielding part when equal knaves contest to gain a lawless passport for the rest here wandring long amid these frowning fields i sought the simple life that nature yields rapine and wrong and fear usurped her place and a bold artful surly savage race who only skilled to take the finny tribe the yearly dinner or septennial bribe wait on the shore and as the waves run high on the tossed vessel bend their eager eye which to their coast directs its ventrous way theirs or the oceans miserable prey as on their neighbouring beach yon swallows stand and wait for favoring winds to leave the land while still for flight the ready wing is spread so waited i the favouring hour and fled fled from these shores where guilt and famine reign and cried ah hapless they who still remain who still remain to hear the ocean roar whose greedy waves devour the lessening shore till some fierce tide with more imperious sway sweeps the low hut and all it holds away when the sad tenant weeps from door to door and begs a poor protection from the poor but these are scenes where natures niggard hand gave a spare portion to the famished land hers is the fault if here mankind complain of fruitless toil and labor spent in vain but yet in other scenes more fair in view where plenty smilesalas she smiles for few and those who taste not yet behold her store are as the slaves that dig the golden ore the wealth around them makes them doubly poor or will you deem them amply paid in health labors fair child that languishes with wealth go then and see them rising with the sun through a long course of daily toil to run like him to make the plenteous harvest grow and yet not shard the plenty they bestow see them beneath the dogstars raging heat when the knees tremble and the temples beat behold them leaning on their scythes look oer the labour past and toils to come explore see them alternate suns and showers engage and hoard up aches and anguish for their age through fens and marshy moors their steps pursue when their warm pores imbibe the evening dew then own that labour may as fatal be to these thy slaves as luxury to thee amid this tribe too oft a manly pride strives in strong toil the fainting heart to hide there may you see the youth of slender frame contend with weakness weariness and shame yet urged along and proudly loth to yield he strives to join his fellows of the field till longcontending nature droops at last declining health rejects his poor repast his cheerless spouse the coming danger sees and mutual murmurs urge the slow disease yet grant them health tis not for us to tell though the head droops not that the heart is well or will you urge their homely plenteous fare healthy and plain and still the poor mans share oh trifle not with wants you cannot feel nor mock the misery of a stinted meal homely not wholesome plain not plenteous such as you who envy would disdain to touch ye gentle souls who dream of rural ease whom the smooth stream and smoother sonnet please go if the peaceful cot your praises share go look within and ask if peace be there if peace be histhat drooping weary sire or theirs that offspring round their feeble fire or hers that matron pale whose trembling hand turns on the wretched hearth th expiring brand nor yet can time itself obtain for these lifes latest comforts due respect and ease for yonder see that hoary swain whose age can with no cares except his own engage who propped on that rude staff looks up to see the bare arms broken from the withering tree on which a boy he climbed the loftiest bough then his first joy but his sad emblem now he once was chief in all the rustic trade his steady hand the straightest furrow made full many a prize he won and still is proud to find the triumphs of his youth allowed a transient pleasure sparkles in his eyes he hears and smiles then thinks again and sighs for now he journeys to his grave in pain the rich disdain him nay the poor disdain alternate masters now their slave command and urge the efforts of his feeble hand who when his age attempts its task in vain with ruthless taunts of lazy poor complain oft may you see him when he tends the sheep his wintercharge beneath the hillock weep oft hear him murmur to the winds that blow oer his white locks and bury them in snow when roused by rage and muttering in the morn he mends the broken hedge with icy thorn why do i live when i desire to be at once from life and lifes long labour free like leaves in spring the young are blown away without the sorrows of a slow decay i like yon withered leaf remain behind nipped by the frost and shivering in the wind there it abides till younger buds come on as i now all my fellowswains are gone then from the rising generation thrust it falls like me unnoticed to the dust these fruitful fields these numerous flocks i see are others gain but killing cares to me to me the children of my youth are lords slow in their gifts but hasty in their words wants of their own demand their care and who feels his own want and succors others too a lonely wretched man in pain i go none need my help and none relieve my woe then let my bones beneath the turf be laid and men forget the wretch they would not aid thus groan the old till by disease oppressed they taste a final woe and then they rest theirs is yon house that holds the parish poor whose walls of mud scarce bear the broken door there where the putrid vapours flagging play and the dull wheel hums doleful through the day there children dwell who know no parents care parents who know no childrens love dwell there heartbroken matrons on their joyless bed forsaken wives and mothers never wed dejected widows with unheeded tears and crippled age with more than childhoodfears the lame the blind and far the happiest they the moping idiot and the madman gay here too the sick their final doom receive here brought amid the scenes of grief to grieve where the loud groans from some sad chamber flow mixed with the clamors of the crowd below here sorrowing they each kindred sorrow scan and the cold charities of man to man whose laws indeed for ruined age provide and strong compulsion plucks the scrap from pride but still that scrap is bought with many a sigh and pride embitters what it cant deny say ye oppressed by some fantastic woes some jarring nerve that baffles your repose who press the downy couch while slaves advance with timid eye to read the distant glance who with sad prayers the weary doctor tease to name the nameless evernew disease who with mock patience dire complaints endure which real pain and that alone can cure how would ye bear in real pain to lie despised neglected left alone to die how would ye bear to draw your latest breath where all thats wretched paves the way for death such is that room which one rude beam divides and naked rafters form the sloping sides where the vile bands that bind the thatch are seen and lath and mud is all that lie between save one dull pane that coarsely patched gives way to the rude tempest yet excludes the day here on a matted flock with dust oerspread the drooping wretch reclines his languid head for him no hand the cordial cup applies nor wipes the tear that stagnates in his eyes no friends with soft discourse his pain beguile nor promise hope till sickness wears a smile but soon a loud and hasty summons calls shakes the thin roof and echoes round the walls anon a figure enters quaintly neat all pride and business bustle and conceit with looks unaltered by these scenes of woe with speed that entering speaks his haste to go he bids the gazing throng around him fly and carries fate and physic in his eye a potent quack long versed in human ills who first insults the victim whom he kills whose murdrous hand a drowsy bench protect and whose most tender mercy is neglect paid by the parish for attendance here he wears contempt upon his sapient sneer in haste he seeks the bed where misery lies impatience marked in his averted eyes and some habitual queries hurried oer without reply he rushes on the door his drooping patient long inured to pain and long unheeded knows remonstrance vain he ceases now the feeble help to crave of man and mutely hastens to the grave but ere his death some pious doubts arise some simple fears which bold bad men despise fain would he ask the parish priest to prove his title certain to the joys above for this he sends the murmuring nurse who calls the holy stranger to these dismal walls and doth not he the pious man appear he passing rich with forty pounds a year ah no a shepherd of a different stock and far unlike him feeds this little flock a jovial youth who thinks his sundays task as much as god or man can fairly ask the rest he gives to loves and labors light to fields the morning and to feasts the night none better skilled the noisy pack to guide to urge their chase to cheer them or to chide sure in his shot his game he seldom missed and seldom failed to win his game at whist then while such honors bloom around his head shall he sit sadly by the sick mans bed to raise the hope he feels not or with zeal to combat fears that evn the pious feel now once again the gloomy scene explore less gloomy now the bitter hour is oer the man of many sorrows sighs no more up yonder hill behold how sadly slow the bier moves winding from the vale below there lie the happy dead from trouble free and the glad parish pays the frugal fee no more oh death thy victim starts to hear churchwarden stern or kingly overseer no more the farmer gets his humble bow thou art his lord the best of tyrants thou now to the church behold the mourners come sedately torpid and devoutly dumb the village children now their games suspend to see the bier that bears their ancient friend for he was one in all their idle sport and like a monarch ruled their little court the pliant bow he formed the flying ball the bat the wicket were his labours all him now they follow to his grave and stand silent and sad and gazing hand in hand while bending low their eager eyes explore the mingled relics of the parish poor the bell tolls late the moping owl flies round fear marks the flight and magnifies the sound the busy priest detained by weightier care defers his duty till the day of prayer and waiting long the crowd retire distressed to think a poor mans bones should lie unblessed
