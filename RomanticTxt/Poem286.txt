the time ive lost in wooing in watching and pursuing the light that lies in womans eyes has been my hearts undoing though wisdom oft has sought me i scornd the lore she brought me my only books were womans looks and follys all theyve taught me  her smile when beauty granted i hung with gaze enchanted like him the sprite whom maids by night oft meet in glen thats haunted like him too beauty won me but while her eyes were on me if once their ray was turnd away oh winds could not outrun me  and are those follies going and is my proud heart growing too cold or wise for brilliant eyes again to set it glowing no vain alas th endeavour from bonds so sweet to sever poor wisdoms chance against a glance is now as weak as ever
