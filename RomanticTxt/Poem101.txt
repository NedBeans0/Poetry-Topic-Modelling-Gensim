there is a strain to read among the hills the old and full of voices  by the source of some free stream whose gladdening presence fills the solitude with sound for in its course even such is thy deep song that seems a part of those high scences a fountain from the heart  or its calm spirit fitly may be taken to the still breast in sunny garden bowers where vernal winds each trees low tones awaken and bud and bell with changes mark the hours there let thy thoughts be with me while the day sinks with a golden and serene decay  or by some hearth where happy faces meet when night hath hushed the woods with all their birds there from some gentle voice that lay were sweet as antique music linked with household words while in pleased murmurs womans lip might move and the raised eye of childhood shine in love  or where the shadows of dark solemn yews brood silently oer some lone burialground thy verse hath power that brightly might diffuse a breath a kindling as of spring around from its own glow of hope and courage high and steadfast faiths victorious constancy  true bard and holy  thou art een as one who by some secret gift of soul or eye in every spot beneath the smiling sun sees where the springs of living waters lie unseen awhile they sleep  till touched by thee bright healthful waves flow forth to each glad wanderer free
