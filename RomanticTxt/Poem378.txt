harmonious powers with nature work on sky earth river lake and sea sunshine and storm whirlwind and breeze all in one duteous task agree  once did i see a slip of earth by throbbing waves long undermined loosed from its hold how no one knew but all might see it float obedient to the wind  might see it from the mossy shore dissevered float upon the lake float with its crest of trees adorned on which the warbling birds their pastime take  food shelter safety there they find there berries ripen flowerets bloom there insects live their lives  and die a peopled world it is in size a tiny room  and thus through many seasons space this little island may survive but nature though we mark her not will take away  may cease to give  perchance when you are wandering forth upon some vacant sunny day without an object hope or fear thither your eyes may turn  the isle is passed away  buried beneath the glittering lake its place no longer to be found yet the lost fragments shall remain to fertilize some other ground
