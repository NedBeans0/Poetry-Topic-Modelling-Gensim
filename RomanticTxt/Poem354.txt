is there a solitary wretch who hies to the tall cliff with starting pace or slow and measuring views with wild and hollow eyes its distance from the waves that chide below who as the seaborn gale with frequent sighs chills his cold bed upon the mountain turf with hoarse halfuttered lamentation lies murmuring responses to the dashing surf in moody sadness on the giddy brink i see him more with envy than with fear he has no nice felicities that shrink from giant horrors wildly wandering here he seems uncursed with reason not to know the depth or the duration of his woe
