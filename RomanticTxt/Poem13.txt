1   i watched thee when the foe was at our side ready to strike at himor thee and me were safety hopelessrather than divide aught with one loved save love and liberty   2   i watched thee on the breakers when the rock received our prow and all was storm and fear and bade thee cling to me through every shock this arm would be thy bark or breast thy bier   3   i watched thee when the fever glazed thine eyes yielding my couch and stretched me on the ground when overworn with watching neer to rise from thence if thou an early grave hadst found   4   the earthquake came and rocked the quivering wall and men and nature reeled as if with wine whom did i seek around the tottering hall for thee whose safety first provide for thine   5   and when convulsive throes denied my breath the faintest utterance to my fading thought to theeto theeeen in the gasp of death my spirit turned oh oftener than it ought   6   thus much and more and yet thou lovst me not and never wilt love dwells not in our will nor can i blame thee though it be my lot to strongly wrongly vainly love thee still
