piping down the valleys wild piping songs of pleasant glee on a cloud i saw a child and he laughing said to me  pipe a song about a lamb so i piped with merry chear piper pipe that song again so i piped he wept to hear  drop thy pipe thy happy pipe sing thy songs of happy chear so i sung the same again while he wept with joy to hear  piper sit thee down and write in a book that all may read so he vanishd from my sight and i pluckd a hollow reed  and i made a rural pen and i staind the water clear and i wrote my happy songs every child may joy to hear
