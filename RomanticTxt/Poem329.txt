who has not waked to list the busy sounds of summers morning in the sultry smoke of noisy london on the pavement hot the sooty chimneyboy with dingy face and tattered covering shrilly bawls his trade rousing the sleepy housemaid at the door the milkpail rattles and the tinkling bell proclaims the dustmans office while the street is lost in clouds impervious now begins the din of hackneycoaches waggons carts while tinmens shops and noisy trunkmakers knifegrinders coopers squeaking corkcutters fruitbarrows and the hungergiving cries of vegetablevendors fill the air now every shop displays its varied trade and the freshsprinkled pavement cools the feet of early walkers at the private door the ruddy housemaid twirls the busy mop annoying the smart prentice or neat girl tripping with bandbox lightly now the sun darts burning splendor on the glittering pane save where the canvas awning throws a shade on the gay merchandise now spruce and trim in shops where beauty smiles with industry sits the smart damsel while the passenger peeps through the window watching every charm now pastry dainties catch the eye minute of humming insects while the limy snare waits to enthrall them now the lamplighter mounts the tall ladder nimbly venturous to trim the halffilled lamps while at his feet the potboy yells discordant all along the sultry pavement the oldclothesman cries in tone monotonous while sidelong views the area for his traffic now the bag is slyly opened and the halfworn suit sometimes the pilfered treasure of the base domestic spoiler for one half its worth sinks in the green abyss the porter now bears his huge load along the burning way and the poor poet wakes from busy dreams to paint the summer morning
