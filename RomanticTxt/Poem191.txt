ere on my bed my limbs i lay it hath not been my use to pray with moving lips or bended knees but silently by slow degrees my spirit i to love compose in humble trust mine eyelids close with reverential resignation no wish conceived no thought exprest only a sense of supplication a sense oer all my soul imprest that i am weak yet not unblest since in me round me every where eternal strength and wisdom are  but yesternight i prayed aloud in anguish and in agony upstarting from the fiendish crowd of shapes and thoughts that tortured me a lurid light a trampling throng sense of intolerable wrong and whom i scorned those only strong thirst of revenge the powerless will still baffled and yet burning still desire with loathing strangely mixed on wild or hateful objects fixed fantastic passions maddening brawl and shame and terror over all deeds to be hid which were not hid which all confused i could not know whether i suffered or i did for all seemed guilt remorse or woe my own or others still the same lifestifling fear soulstifling shame  so two nights passed the nights dismay saddened and stunned the coming day sleep the wide blessing seemed to me distempers worst calamity the third night when my own loud scream had waked me from the fiendish dream oercome with sufferings strange and wild i wept as i had been a child and having thus by tears subdued my anguish to a milder mood such punishments i said were due to natures deepliest stained with sin for aye entempesting anew the unfathomable hell within the horror of their deeds to view to know and loathe yet wish and do such griefs with such men well agree but wherefore wherefore fall on me to be loved is all i need and whom i love i love indeed
