down in a green and shady bed a modest violet grew its stalk was bent it hung its head as if to hide from view  and yet it was a lovely flower its colours bright and fair it might have graced a rosy bower instead of hiding there  yet there it was content to bloom in modest tints arrayed and there diffused its sweet perfume within the silent shade  then let me to the valley go this pretty flower to see that i may also learn to grow in sweet humility
