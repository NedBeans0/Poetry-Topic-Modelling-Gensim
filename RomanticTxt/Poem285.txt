oft in the stilly night ere slumbers chain has bound me fond memory brings the light of other days around me the smiles the tears of boyhoods years the words of love then spoken the eyes that shone now dimmd and gone the cheerful hearts now broken thus in the stilly night ere slumbers chain hath bound me sad memory brings the light of other days around me  when i remember all the friends so linkd together ive seen around me fall like leaves in wintry weather i feel like one who treads alone some banquethall deserted whose lights are fled whose garlands dead and all but he departed thus in the stilly night ere slumbers chain has bound me sad memory brings the light of other days around me
