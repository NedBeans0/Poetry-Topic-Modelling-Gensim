excerpt book i  deep in the shady sadness of a vale far sunken from the healthy breath of morn far from the fiery noon and eves one star sat grayhaird saturn quiet as a stone still as the silence round about his lair forest on forest hung about his head like cloud on cloud no stir of air was there not so much life as on a summers day robs not one light seed from the featherd grass but where the dead leaf fell there did it rest a stream went voiceless by still deadened more by reason of his fallen divinity spreading a shade the naiad mid her reeds pressd her cold finger closer to her lips  along the marginsand large footmarks went no further than to where his feet had strayd and slept there since upon the sodden ground his old right hand lay nerveless listless dead unsceptred and his realmless eyes were closed while his bowd head seemd listning to the earth his ancient mother for some comfort yet  it seemd no force could wake him from his place but there came one who with a kindred hand touchd his wide shoulders after bending low with reverence though to one who knew it not she was a goddess of the infant world by her in stature the tall amazon had stood a pigmys height she would have taen achilles by the hair and bent his neck or with a finger stayd ixions wheel her face was large as that of memphian sphinx pedestald haply in a palace court when sages lookd to egypt for their lore but oh how unlike marble was that face how beautiful if sorrow had not made sorrow more beautiful than beautys self there was a listening fear in her regard as if calamity had but begun as if the vanward clouds of evil days had spent their malice and the sullen rear was with its stored thunder labouring up one hand she pressd upon that aching spot where beats the human heart as if just there though an immortal she felt cruel pain the other upon saturns bended neck she laid and to the level of his ear leaning with parted lips some words she spake in solemn tenour and deep organ tone some mourning words which in our feeble tongue would come in these like accents o how frail to that large utterance of the early gods saturn look upthough wherefore poor old king i have no comfort for thee no not one i cannot say o wherefore sleepest thou for heaven is parted from thee and the earth knows thee not thus afflicted for a god and ocean too with all its solemn noise has from thy sceptre passd and all the air is emptied of thine hoary majesty thy thunder conscious of the new command rumbles reluctant oer our fallen house and thy sharp lightning in unpractisd hands scorches and burns our once serene domain o aching time o moments big as years all as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth and press it so upon our weary griefs that unbelief has not a space to breathe saturn sleep ono thoughtless why did i thus violate thy slumbrous solitude why should i ope thy melancholy eyes saturn sleep on while at thy feet i weep  as when upon a tranced summernight those greenrobd senators of mighty woods tall oaks branchcharmed by the earnest stars dream and so dream all night without a stir save from one gradual solitary gust which comes upon the silence and dies off as if the ebbing air had but one wave so came these words and went the while in tears she touchd her fair large forehead to the ground just where her falling hair might be outspread a soft and silken mat for saturns feet one moon with alteration slow had shed her silver seasons four upon the night and still these two were postured motionless like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern the frozen god still couchant on the earth and the sad goddess weeping at his feet until at length old saturn lifted up his faded eyes and saw his kingdom gone and all the gloom and sorrow of the place and that fair kneeling goddess and then spake as with a palsied tongue and while his beard shook horrid with such aspenmalady o tender spouse of gold hyperion thea i feel thee ere i see thy face look up and let me see our doom in it look up and tell me if this feeble shape is saturns tell me if thou hearst the voice of saturn tell me if this wrinkling brow naked and bare of its great diadem peers like the front of saturn who had power to make me desolate whence came the strength how was it nurturd to such bursting forth while fate seemd strangled in my nervous grasp but it is so and i am smotherd up and buried from all godlike exercise of influence benign on planets pale of admonitions to the winds and seas of peaceful sway above mans harvesting and all those acts which deity supreme doth ease its heart of love ini am gone away from my own bosom i have left my strong identity my real self somewhere between the throne and where i sit here on this spot of earth search thea search open thine eyes eterne and sphere them round upon all space space starrd and lorn of light space regiond with lifeair and barren void spaces of fire and all the yawn of hell search thea search and tell me if thou seest a certain shape or shadow making way with wings or chariot fierce to repossess a heaven he lost erewhile it mustit must be of ripe progresssaturn must be king yes there must be a golden victory there must be gods thrown down and trumpets blown of triumph calm and hymns of festival upon the gold clouds metropolitan voices of soft proclaim and silver stir of strings in hollow shells and there shall be beautiful things made new for the surprise of the skychildren i will give command thea thea thea where is saturn  this passion lifted him upon his feet and made his hands to struggle in the air his druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat his eyes to fever out his voice to cease he stood and heard not theas sobbing deep a little time and then again he snatchd utterance thusbut cannot i create cannot i form cannot i fashion forth another world another universe to overbear and crumble this to nought where is another chaos wherethat word found way unto olympus and made quake the rebel threethea was startled up and in her bearing was a sort of hope as thus she quickvoicd spake yet full of awe this cheers our fallen house come to our friends o saturn come away and give them heart i know the covert from thence came i hither thus brief then with beseeching eyes she went with backward footing through the shade a space he followd and she turnd to lead the way through aged boughs that yielded like the mist which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest  meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed more sorrow like to this and such like woe too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe the titans fierce selfhid or prisonbound groand for the old allegiance once more and listend in sharp pain for saturns voice but one of the whole mammothbrood still kept his sovreignty and rule and majesty blazing hyperion on his orbed fire still sat still snuffd the incense teeming up from man to the suns god yet unsecure for as among us mortals omens drear fright and perplex so also shuddered he not at dogs howl or gloombirds hated screech or the familiar visiting of one upon the first toll of his passing bell or prophesyings of the midnight lamp but horrors portiond to a giant nerve oft made hyperion ache his palace bright bastiond with pyramids of glowing gold and touchd with shade of bronzed obelisks glard a bloodred through all its thousand courts arches and domes and fiery galleries and all its curtains of aurorian clouds flushd angerly while sometimes eagles wings unseen before by gods or wondering men darkend the place and neighing steeds were heard not heard before by gods or wondering men also when he would taste the spicy wreaths of incense breathd aloft from sacred hills instead of sweets his ample palate took savour of poisonous brass and metal sick and so when harbourd in the sleepy west after the full completion of fair day for rest divine upon exalted couch and slumber in the arms of melody he pacd away the pleasant hours of ease with stride colossal on from hall to hall while far within each aisle and deep recess his winged minions in close clusters stood amazd and full of fear like anxious men who on wide plains gather in panting troops when earthquakes jar their battlements and towers even now while saturn rousd from icy trance went step for step with thea through the woods hyperion leaving twilight in the rear came slope upon the threshold of the west then as was wont his palacedoor flew ope in smoothest silence save what solemn tubes blown by the serious zephyrs gave of sweet and wandering sounds slowbreathed melodies and like a rose in vermeil tint and shape in fragrance soft and coolness to the eye that inlet to severe magnificence stood full blown for the god to enter in  he enterd but he enterd full of wrath his flaming robes streamd out beyond his heels and gave a roar as if of earthly fire that scard away the meek ethereal hours and made their dovewings tremble on he flared from stately nave to nave from vault to vault through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light and diamondpaved lustrous long arcades until he reachd the great main cupola there standing fierce beneath he stampt his foot and from the basements deep to the high towers jarrd his own golden region and before the quavering thunder thereupon had ceasd his voice leapt out despite of godlike curb to this result o dreams of day and night o monstrous forms o effigies of pain o spectres busy in a cold cold gloom o lankeard phantoms of blackweeded pools why do i know ye why have i seen ye why is my eternal essence thus distraught to see and to behold these horrors new saturn is fallen am i too to fall am i to leave this haven of my rest this cradle of my glory this soft clime this calm luxuriance of blissful light these crystalline pavilions and pure fanes of all my lucent empire it is left deserted void nor any haunt of mine the blaze the splendour and the symmetry i cannot seebut darkness death and darkness even here into my centre of repose the shady visions come to domineer insult and blind and stifle up my pomp fallno by tellus and her briny robes over the fiery frontier of my realms i will advance a terrible right arm shall scare that infant thunderer rebel jove and bid old saturn take his throne again he spake and ceasd the while a heavier threat held struggle with his throat but came not forth for as in the theatres of crowded men hubbub increases more they call out hush so at hyperions words the phantoms pale bestirrd themselves thrice horrible and cold and from the mirrord level where he stood a mist arose as from a scummy marsh at this through all his bulk an agony crept gradual from the feet unto the crown like a lithe serpent vast and muscular making slow way with head and neck convulsd from overstrained might releasd he fled to the eastern gates and full six dewy hours before the dawn in season due should blush he breathd fierce breath against the sleepy portals cleard them of heavy vapours burst them wide suddenly on the oceans chilly streams the planet orb of fire whereon he rode each day from east to west the heavens through spun round in sable curtaining of clouds nor therefore veiled quite blindfold and hid but ever and anon the glancing spheres circles and arcs and broadbelting colure glowd through and wrought upon the muffling dark sweetshaped lightnings from the nadir deep up to the zenithhieroglyphics old which sages and keeneyd astrologers then living on the earth with labouring thought won from the gaze of many centuries now lost save what we find on remnants huge of stone or marble swart their import gone their wisdom long since fledtwo wings this orb possessd for glory two fair argent wings ever exalted at the gods approach and now from forth the gloom their plumes immense rose one by one till all outspreaded were while still the dazzling globe maintaind eclipse awaiting for hyperions command fain would he have commanded fain took throne and bid the day begin if but for change he might notno though a primeval god the sacred seasons might not be disturbd therefore the operations of the dawn stayd in their birth even as here tis told those silver wings expanded sisterly eager to sail their orb the porches wide opend upon the dusk demesnes of night and the bright titan phrenzied with new woes unusd to bend by hard compulsion bent his spirit to the sorrow of the time and all along a dismal rack of clouds upon the boundaries of day and night he stretchd himself in grief and radiance faint there as he lay the heaven with its stars lookd down on him with pity and the voice of coelus from the universal space thus whisperd low and solemn in his ear o brightest of my children dear earthborn and skyengendered son of mysteries all unrevealed even to the powers which met at thy creating at whose joys and palpitations sweet and pleasures soft i coelus wonder how they came and whence and at the fruits thereof what shapes they be distinct and visible symbols divine manifestations of that beauteous life diffusd unseen throughout eternal space of these newformd art thou oh brightest child of these thy brethren and the goddesses there is sad feud among ye and rebellion of son against his sire i saw him fall i saw my firstborn tumbled from his throne to me his arms were spread to me his voice found way from forth the thunders round his head pale wox i and in vapours hid my face art thou too near such doom vague fear there is for i have seen my sons most unlike gods divine ye were created and divine in sad demeanour solemn undisturbd unruffled like high gods ye livd and ruled now i behold in you fear hope and wrath actions of rage and passion even as i see them on the mortal world beneath in men who diethis is the grief o son sad sign of ruin sudden dismay and fall yet do thou strive as thou art capable as thou canst move about an evident god and canst oppose to each malignant hour ethereal presencei am but a voice my life is but the life of winds and tides no more than winds and tides can i avail but thou canstbe thou therefore in the van of circumstance yea seize the arrows barb before the tense string murmurto the earth for there thou wilt find saturn and his woes meanwhile i will keep watch on thy bright sun and of thy seasons be a careful nurse ere half this regionwhisper had come down hyperion arose and on the stars lifted his curved lids and kept them wide until it ceasd and still he kept them wide and still they were the same bright patient stars then with a slow incline of his broad breast like to a diver in the pearly seas forward he stoopd over the airy shore and plungd all noiseless into the deep night
