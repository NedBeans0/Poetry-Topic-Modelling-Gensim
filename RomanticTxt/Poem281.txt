there robert you have killd that fly   and should you thousand ages try the life youve taken to supply you could not do it  you surely must have been devoid of thought and sense to have destroyd a thing which no way you annoyd  youll one day rue it  twas but a fly perhaps youll say thats born in april dies in may that does but just learn to display his wings one minute  and in the next is vanishd quite a bird devours it in his flight  or come a cold blast in the night theres no breath in it  the bird but seeks his proper food  and providence whose power endud that fly with life when it thinks good may justly take it  but you have no excuses fort  a life by nature made so short less reason is that you for sport should shorter make it  a fly a little thing you rate  but robert do not estimate a creatures pain by small or great the greatest being  can have but fibres nerves and flesh and these the smallest ones possess although their frame and structure less escape our seeing
