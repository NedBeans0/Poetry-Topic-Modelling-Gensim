the world is too much with us late and soon getting and spending we lay waste our powers little we see in nature that is ours we have given our hearts away a sordid boon this sea that bares her bosom to the moon the winds that will be howling at all hours and are upgathered now like sleeping flowers for this for everything we are out of tune it moves us not great god id rather be a pagan suckled in a creed outworn so might i standing on this pleasant lea have glimpses that would make me less forlorn have sight of proteus rising from the sea or hear old triton blow his wreath√®d horn
