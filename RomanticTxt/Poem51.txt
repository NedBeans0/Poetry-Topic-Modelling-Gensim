there is a smile of love and there is a smile of deceit and there is a smile of smiles in which these two smiles meet  and there is a frown of hate and there is a frown of disdain and there is a frown of frowns which you strive to forget in vain  for it sticks in the hearts deep core and it sticks in the deep back bone and no smile that ever was smild but only one smile alone  that betwixt the cradle amp grave it only once smild can be but when it once is smild theres an end to all misery
