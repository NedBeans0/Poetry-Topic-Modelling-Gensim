my days among the dead are past around me i behold whereer these casual eyes are cast the mighty minds of old my neverfailing friends are they with whom i converse day by day  with them i take delight in weal and seek relief in woe and while i understand and feel how much to them i owe my cheeks have often been bedewd with tears of thoughtful gratitude  my thoughts are with the dead with them i live in longpast years their virtues love their faults condemn partake their hopes and fears and from their lessons seek and find instruction with an humble mind  my hopes are with the dead anon my place with them will be and i with them shall travel on through all futurity yet leaving here a name i trust that will not perish in the dust
