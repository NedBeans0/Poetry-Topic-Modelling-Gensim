i had a dream which was not all a dream the bright sun was extinguishd and the stars did wander darkling in the eternal space rayless and pathless and the icy earth swung blind and blackening in the moonless air morn came and wentand came and brought no day and men forgot their passions in the dread of this their desolation and all hearts were chilld into a selfish prayer for light and they did live by watchfiresand the thrones the palaces of crowned kingsthe huts the habitations of all things which dwell were burnt for beacons cities were consumd and men were gatherd round their blazing homes to look once more into each others face happy were those who dwelt within the eye of the volcanos and their mountaintorch a fearful hope was all the world containd forests were set on firebut hour by hour they fell and fadedand the crackling trunks extinguishd with a crashand all was black the brows of men by the despairing light wore an unearthly aspect as by fits the flashes fell upon them some lay down and hid their eyes and wept and some did rest their chins upon their clenched hands and smild and others hurried to and fro and fed their funeral piles with fuel and lookd up with mad disquietude on the dull sky the pall of a past world and then again with curses cast them down upon the dust and gnashd their teeth and howld the wild birds shriekd and terrified did flutter on the ground and flap their useless wings the wildest brutes came tame and tremulous and vipers crawld and twind themselves among the multitude hissing but stinglessthey were slain for food and war which for a moment was no more did glut himself again a meal was bought with blood and each sate sullenly apart gorging himself in gloom no love was left all earth was but one thoughtand that was death immediate and inglorious and the pang of famine fed upon all entrailsmen died and their bones were tombless as their flesh the meagre by the meagre were devourd even dogs assaild their masters all save one and he was faithful to a corse and kept the birds and beasts and famishd men at bay till hunger clung them or the dropping dead lurd their lank jaws himself sought out no food but with a piteous and perpetual moan and a quick desolate cry licking the hand which answerd not with a caresshe died the crowd was famishd by degrees but two of an enormous city did survive and they were enemies they met beside the dying embers of an altarplace where had been heapd a mass of holy things for an unholy usage they rakd up and shivering scrapd with their cold skeleton hands the feeble ashes and their feeble breath blew for a little life and made a flame which was a mockery then they lifted up their eyes as it grew lighter and beheld each others aspectssaw and shriekd and died even of their mutual hideousness they died unknowing who he was upon whose brow famine had written fiend the world was void the populous and the powerful was a lump seasonless herbless treeless manless lifeless a lump of deatha chaos of hard clay the rivers lakes and ocean all stood still and nothing stirrd within their silent depths ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea and their masts fell down piecemeal as they droppd they slept on the abyss without a surge the waves were dead the tides were in their grave the moon their mistress had expird before the winds were witherd in the stagnant air and the clouds perishd darkness had no need of aid from themshe was the universe
