i heard a thousand blended notes while in a grove i sate reclined in that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts bring sad thoughts to the mind  to her fair works did nature link the human soul that through me ran and much it grieved my heart to think what man has made of man  through primrose tufts in that green bower the periwinkle trailed its wreaths and tis my faith that every flower enjoys the air it breathes  the birds around me hopped and played their thoughts i cannot measure but the least motion which they made it seemed a thrill of pleasure  the budding twigs spread out their fan to catch the breezy air and i must think do all i can that there was pleasure there  if this belief from heaven be sent if such be natures holy plan have i not reason to lament what man has made of man
