rarely rarely comest thou spirit of delight wherefore hast thou left me now many a day and night many a weary night and day tis since thou are fled away  how shall ever one like me win thee back again with the joyous and the free thou wilt scoff at pain spirit false thou hast forgot all but those who need thee not  as a lizard with the shade of a trembling leaf thou with sorrow art dismayd even the sighs of grief reproach thee that thou art not near and reproach thou wilt not hear  let me set my mournful ditty to a merry measure thou wilt never come for pity thou wilt come for pleasure pity then will cut away those cruel wings and thou wilt stay  i love all that thou lovest spirit of delight the fresh earth in new leaves dressd and the starry night autumn evening and the morn when the golden mists are born  i love snow and all the forms of the radiant frost i love waves and winds and storms everything almost which is natures and may be untainted by mans misery  i love tranquil solitude and such society as is quiet wise and good between thee and me what difference but thou dost possess the things i seek not love them less  i love lovethough he has wings and like light can flee but above all other things spirit i love thee thou art love and life oh come make once more my heart thy home
