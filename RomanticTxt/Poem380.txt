a month sweet littleones is past since your dear mother went away and she tomorrow will return tomorrow is the happy day  o blessed tidings thoughts of joy the eldest heard with steady glee silent he stood then laughed amain and shouted mother come to me  louder and louder did he shout with witless hope to bring her near nay patience patience little boy your tender mother cannot hear  i told of hills and faroff towns and long long vales to travel through he listened puzzled sore perplexed but he submits what can he do  no strike disturbs his sisters breast she wars not with the mystery of time and distance night and day the bonds of our humanity  her joy is like an instinct joy of kitten bird or summer fly she dances runs without an aim she chatters in her ecstasy  her brother now takes up the note and echoes back his sisters glee they hug the infant in my arms as if to force his sympathy  then settling into fond discourse we rested in the garden bower while sweetly shone the evening sun in his departing hour  we told oer all that we had done our rambles by the swift brooks side far as the willowskirted pool where two fair swans together glide  we talked of change of winter gone of green leaves on the hawthorn spray of birds that build their nests and sing and all since mother went away  to her these tales they will repeat to her our newborn tribes will show the goslings green the asss colt the lambs that in the meadow go   but see the evening star comes forth to bed the children must depart a moments heaviness they feel a sadness at the heart  tis gone  and in a merry fit they run up stairs in gamesome race i too infected by their mood i could have joined the wanton chase  five minutes past  and o the change asleep upon their beds they lie their busy limbs in perfect rest and closed the sparkling eye
