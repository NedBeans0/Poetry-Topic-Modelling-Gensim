and thou art dead as young and fair as aught of mortal birth and form so soft and charms so rare too soon returnd to earth though earth receivd them in her bed and oer the spot the crowd may tread in carelessness or mirth there is an eye which could not brook a moment on that grave to look  i will not ask where thou liest low nor gaze upon the spot there flowers or weeds at will may grow so i behold them not it is enough for me to prove that what i lovd and long must love like common earth can rot to me there needs no stone to tell t is nothing that i lovd so well  yet did i love thee to the last as fervently as thou who didst not change through all the past and canst not alter now the love where death has set his seal nor age can chill nor rival steal nor falsehood disavow and what were worse thou canst not see or wrong or change or fault in me  the better days of life were ours the worst can be but mine the sun that cheers the storm that lowers shall never more be thine the silence of that dreamless sleep i envy now too much to weep nor need i to repine that all those charms have passd away i might have watchd through long decay  the flower in ripend bloom unmatchd must fall the earliest prey though by no hand untimely snatchd the leaves must drop away and yet it were a greater grief to watch it withering leaf by leaf than see it pluckd today since earthly eye but ill can bear to trace the change to foul from fair  i know not if i could have borne to see thy beauties fade the night that followd such a morn had worn a deeper shade thy day without a cloud hath passd and thou wert lovely to the last extinguishd not decayd as stars that shoot along the sky shine brightest as they fall from high  as once i wept if i could weep my tears might well be shed to think i was not near to keep one vigil oer thy bed to gaze how fondly on thy face to fold thee in a faint embrace uphold thy drooping head and show that love however vain nor thou nor i can feel again  yet how much less it were to gain though thou hast left me free the loveliest things that still remain than thus remember thee the all of thine that cannot die through dark and dread eternity returns again to me and more thy buried love endears than aught except its living years
