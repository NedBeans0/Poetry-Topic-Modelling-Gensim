i  ye clouds that far above me float and pause whose pathless march no mortal may control ye oceanwaves that wheresoeer ye roll yield homage only to eternal laws ye woods that listen to the nightbirds singing midway the smooth and perilous slope reclined save when your own imperious branches swinging have made a solemn music of the wind where like a man beloved of god through glooms which never woodman trod how oft pursuing fancies holy my moonlight way oer flowering weeds i wound inspired beyond the guess of folly by each rude shape and wild unconquerable sound o ye loud waves and o ye forests high and o ye clouds that far above me soared thou rising sun thou blue rejoicing sky yea every thing that is and will be free bear witness for me wheresoeer ye be with what deep worship i have still adored the spirit of divinest liberty  ii  when france in wrath her giantlimbs upreared and with that oath which smote air earth and sea stamped her strong foot and said she would be free bear witness for me how i hoped and feared with what a joy my lofty gratulation unawed i sang amid a slavish band and when to whelm the disenchanted nation like fiends embattled by a wizards wand the monarchs marched in evil day and britain joined the dire array though dear her shores and circling ocean though many friendships many youthful loves had swoln the patriot emotion and flung a magic light oer all her hills and groves yet still my voice unaltered sang defeat to all that braved the tyrantquelling lance and shame too long delayed and vain retreat for neer o liberty with partial aim i dimmed thy light or damped thy holy flame but blessed the paeans of delivered france and hung my head and wept at britains name  iii  and what i said though blasphemys loud scream with that sweet music of deliverance strove though all the fierce and drunken passions wove a dance more wild than eer was maniacs dream ye storms that round the dawning east assembled the sun was rising though ye hid his light and when to soothe my soul that hoped and trembled the dissonance ceased and all seemed calm and bright when france her front deepscarrd and gory concealed with clustering wreaths of glory when insupportably advancing her arm made mockery of the warriors ramp while timid looks of fury glancing domestic treason crushed beneath her fatal stamp writhed like a wounded dragon in his gore then i reproached my fears that would not flee and soon i said shall wisdom teach her lore in the low huts of them that toil and groan and conquering by her happiness alone shall france compel the nations to be free till love and joy look round and call the earth their own  iv  forgive me freedom o forgive those dreams i hear thy voice i hear thy loud lament from bleak helvetias icy caverns sent i hear thy groans upon her bloodstained streams heroes that for your peaceful country perished and ye that fleeing spot your mountainsnows with bleeding wounds forgive me that i cherished one thought that ever blessed your cruel foes to scatter rage and traitorous guilt where peace her jealous home had built a patriotrace to disinherit of all that made their stormy wilds so dear and with inexpiable spirit to taint the bloodless freedom of the mountaineer o france that mockest heaven adulterous blind and patriot only in pernicious toils are these thy boasts champion of human kind to mix with kings in the low lust of sway yell in the hunt and share the murderous prey to insult the shrine of liberty with spoils from freemen torn to tempt and to betray  v  the sensual and the dark rebel in vain slaves by their own compulsion in mad game they burst their manacles and wear the name of freedom graven on a heavier chain o liberty with profitless endeavour have i pursued thee many a weary hour but thou nor swellst the victors strain nor ever didst breathe thy soul in forms of human power alike from all howeer they praise thee nor prayer nor boastful name delays thee alike from priestcrafts harpy minions and factious blasphemys obscener slaves thou speedest on thy subtle pinions the guide of homeless winds and playmate of the waves and there i felt theeon that seacliffs verge whose pines scarce travelled by the breeze above had made one murmur with the distant surge yes while i stood and gazed my temples bare and shot my being through earth sea and air possessing all things with intensest love o liberty my spirit felt thee there
