chorus ca the yowes to the knowes ca them where the heather grows ca them where the burnie rows my bonie dearie  hark the mavis evening sang sounding cludens woods amang then afauldin let us gang my bonie dearie  well gae down by cluden side thro the hazels spreading wide oer the waves that sweetly glide to the moon sae clearly  yonder cludens silent towers where at moonshine midnight hours oer the dewybending flowers fairies dance sae cheery  ghaist nor bogle shalt thou fear thou rt to love and heaven sae dear nocht of ill may come thee near my bonie dearie  fair and lovely as thou art thou hast stown my very heart i can diebut canna part my bonie dearie
