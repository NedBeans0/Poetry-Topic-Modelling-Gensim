i there is a thornit looks so old in truth youd find it hard to say how it could ever have been young it looks so old and grey not higher than a two years child it stands erect this aged thorn no leaves it has no prickly points it is a mass of knotted joints a wretched thing forlorn it stands erect and like a stone with lichens is it overgrown  ii like rock or stone it is oergrown with lichens to the very top and hung with heavy tufts of moss a melancholy crop up from the earth these mosses creep and this poor thorn they clasp it round so close youd say that they are bent with plain and manifest intent to drag it to the ground and all have joined in one endeavour to bury this poor thorn for ever  iii high on a mountains highest ridge where oft the stormy winter gale cuts like a scythe while through the clouds it sweeps from vale to vale not five yards from the mountain path this thorn you on your left espy and to the left three yards beyond you see a little muddy pond of waternever dry though but of compass small and bare to thirsty suns and parching air  iv and close beside this aged thorn there is a fresh and lovely sight a beauteous heap a hill of moss just half a foot in height all lovely colours there you see all colours that were ever seen and mossy network too is there as if by hand of lady fair the work had woven been and cups the darlings of the eye so deep is their vermilion dye  v ah me what lovely tints are there of olive green and scarlet bright in spikes in branches and in stars green red and pearly white this heap of earth oergrown with moss which close beside the thorn you see so fresh in all its beauteous dyes is like an infants grave in size as like as like can be but never never any where an infants grave was half so fair  vi now would you see this aged thorn this pond and beauteous hill of moss you must take care and choose your time the mountain when to cross for oft there sits between the heap so like an infants grave in size and that same pond of which i spoke a woman in a scarlet cloak and to herself she cries oh misery oh misery oh woe is me oh misery  vii at all times of the day and night this wretched woman thither goes and she is known to every star and every wind that blows and there beside the thorn she sits when the blue daylights in the skies and when the whirlwinds on the hill or frosty air is keen and still and to herself she cries oh misery oh misery oh woe is me oh misery   viii now wherefore thus by day and night in rain in tempest and in snow thus to the dreary mountaintop does this poor woman go and why sits she beside the thorn when the blue daylights in the sky or when the whirlwinds on the hill or frosty air is keen and still and wherefore does she cry o wherefore wherefore tell me why does she repeat that doleful cry  ix i cannot tell i wish i could for the true reason no one knows but would you gladly view the spot the spot to which she goes the hillock like an infants grave the pondand thorn so old and grey pass by her doortis seldom shut and if you see her in her hut then to the spot away i never heard of such as dare approach the spot when she is there  x but wherefore to the mountaintop can this unhappy woman go whatever star is in the skies whatever wind may blow full twenty years are past and gone since she her name is martha ray gave with a maidens true goodwill her company to stephen hill and she was blithe and gay while friends and kindred all approved of him whom tenderly she loved  xi and they had fixed the wedding day the morning that must wed them both but stephen to another maid had sworn another oath and with this other maid to church unthinking stephen went poor martha on that woeful day a pang of pitiless dismay into her soul was sent a fire was kindled in her breast which might not burn itself to rest  xii they say full six months after this while yet the summer leaves were green she to the mountaintop would go and there was often seen what could she seekor wish to hide her state to any eye was plain she was with child and she was mad yet often was she sober sad from her exceeding pain o guilty fatherwould that death had saved him from that breach of faith  xiii sad case for such a brain to hold communion with a stirring child sad case as you may think for one who had a brain so wild last christmaseve we talked of this and greyhaired wilfred of the glen held that the unborn infant wrought about its mothers heart and brought her senses back again and when at last her time drew near her looks were calm her senses clear  xiv more know i not i wish i did and it should all be told to you for what became of this poor child no mortal ever knew nayif a child to her was born no earthly tongue could ever tell and if twas born alive or dead far less could this with proof be said but some remember well that martha ray about this time would up the mountain often climb  xv and all that winter when at night the wind blew from the mountainpeak twas worth your while though in the dark the churchyard path to seek for many a time and oft were heard cries coming from the mountain head some plainly living voices were and others ive heard many swear were voices of the dead i cannot think whateer they say they had to do with martha ray  xvi but that she goes to this old thorn the thorn which i described to you and there sits in a scarlet cloak i will be sworn is true for one day with my telescope to view the ocean wide and bright when to this country first i came ere i had heard of marthas name i climbed the mountains height a storm came on and i could see no object higher than my knee  xvii Â twas mist and rain and storm and rain no screen no fence could i discover and then the wind in sooth it was a wind full ten times over i looked around i thought i saw a jutting cragand off i ran headforemost through the driving rain the shelter of the crag to gain and as i am a man instead of jutting crag i found a woman seated on the ground  xviii i did not speaki saw her face her faceit was enough for me i turned about and heard her cry oh misery oh misery and there she sits until the moon through half the clear blue sky will go and when the little breezes make the waters of the pond to shake as all the country know she shudders and you hear her cry oh misery oh misery   xix but whats the thorn and what the pond and what the hill of moss to her and what the creeping breeze that comes the little pond to stir i cannot tell but some will say she hanged her baby on the tree some say she drowned it in the pond which is a little step beyond but all and each agree the little babe was buried there beneath that hill of moss so fair  xx ive heard the moss is spotted red with drops of that poor infants blood but kill a newborn infant thus i do not think she could some say if to the pond you go and fix on it a steady view the shadow of a babe you trace a baby and a babys face and that it looks at you wheneer you look on it tis plain the baby looks at you again  xxi and some had sworn an oath that she should be to public justice brought and for the little infants bones with spades they would have sought but instantly the hill of moss before their eyes began to stir and for full fifty yards around the grassit shook upon the ground yet all do still aver the little babe lies buried there beneath that hill of moss so fair  xxii i cannot tell how this may be but plain it is the thorn is bound with heavy tufts of moss that strive to drag it to the ground and this i know full many a time when she was on the mountain high by day and in the silent night when all the stars shone clear and bright that i have heard her cry oh misery oh misery oh woe is me oh misery
