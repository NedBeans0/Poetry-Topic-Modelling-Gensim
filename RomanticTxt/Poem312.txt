a physician of eminence some years ago was called in  to attend on a lady of fashion who had long been admired  and the toast of each beau tho now  her sunk features excited compassion  the doctor no sooner the lady had eyed than he begged she for once would his freedom forgive if he stepped from the rules of good breeding aside to mention the terms on which she might live  by all means cried the lady for surely no word a physician may utter should eer give offence punctilio in illness is always absurd and shows either doctor or patient wants sense  why then my dear lady i cannot resist pronouncing this truth like a plain honest man that if in the use of white paint you persist no medicine will save you do all that i can  you astonish me doctor but such is my case that i may as well die  as leave painting alone for should i appear with my natural face  amongst my acquaintance  i should not be known
