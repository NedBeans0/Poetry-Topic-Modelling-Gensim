o my luve is like a red red rose thats newly sprung in june o my luve is like the melody thats sweetly played in tune  so fair art thou my bonnie lass so deep in luve am i and i will luve thee still my dear till a the seas gang dry  till a the seas gang dry my dear and the rocks melt wi the sun i will love thee still my dear while the sands o life shall run  and fare thee weel my only luve and fare thee weel awhile and i will come again my luve though it were ten thousand mile
