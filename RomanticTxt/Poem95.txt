best and brightest come away fairer far than this fair day which like thee to those in sorrow comes to bid a sweet goodmorrow to the rough year just awake in its cradle on the brake the brightest hour of unborn spring through the winter wandering found it seems the halcyon morn to hoar february born bending from heaven in azure mirth it kissed the forehead of the earth and smiled upon the silent sea and bade the frozen streams be free and waked to music all their fountains and breathed upon the frozen mountains and like a prophetess of may strewed flowers upon the barren way making the wintry world appear like one on whom thou smilest dear away away from men and towns to the wild wood and the downs to the silent wilderness where the soul need not repress its music lest it should not find an echo in anothers mind while the touch of natures art harmonizes heart to heart i leave this notice on my door for each accustomed visitor i am gone into the fields to take what this sweet hour yields reflection you may come tomorrow sit by the fireside with sorrow you with the unpaid bill despair you tiresome versereciter care i will pay you in the grave death will listen to your stave expectation too be off today is for itself enough hope in pity mock not woe with smiles nor follow where i go long having lived on thy sweet food at length i find one moments good after long painwith all your love this you never told me of  radiant sister of the day awake arise and come away to the wild woods and the plains and the pools where winter rains image all their roof of leaves where the pine its garland weaves of sapless green and ivy dun round stems that never kiss the sun where the lawns and pastures be and the sandhills of the sea where the melting hoarfrost wets the daisystar that never sets and windflowers and violets which yet join not scent to hue crown the pale year weak and new when the night is left behind in the deep east dun and blind and the blue noon is over us and the multitudinous billows murmur at our feet where the earth and ocean meet and all things seem only one in the universal sun
