it seems a day i speak of one from many singled out one of those heavenly days that cannot die when in the eagerness of boyish hope i left our cottagethreshold sallying forth with a huge wallet oer my shoulders slung a nuttingcrook in hand and turned my steps towrd some fardistant wood a figure quaint tricked out in proud disguise of castoff weeds which for that service had been husbanded by exhortation of my frugal dame motley accoutrement of power to smile at thorns and brakes and bramblesand in truth more ragged than need was oer pathless rocks through beds of matted fern and tangled thickets forcing my way i came to one dear nook unvisited where not a broken bough drooped with its withered leaves ungracious sign of devastation but the hazels rose tall and erect with tempting clusters hung a virgin scenea little while i stood breathing with such suppression of the heart as joy delights in and with wise restraint voluptuous fearless of a rival eyed the banquetor beneath the trees i sate among the flowers and with the flowers i played a temper known to those who after long and weary expectation have been blest with sudden happiness beyond all hope perhaps it was a bower beneath whose leaves the violets of five seasons reappear and fade unseen by any human eye where fairy waterbreaks do murmur on for ever and i saw the sparkling foam andwith my cheek on one of those green stones that fleeced with moss under the shady trees lay round me scattered like a flock of sheep i heard the murmur and the murmuring sound in that sweet mood when pleasure loves to pay tribute to ease and of its joy secure the heart luxuriates with indifferent things wasting its kindliness on stocks and stones and on the vacant air then up i rose and dragged to earth both branch and bough with crash and merciless ravage and the shady nook of hazels and the green and mossy bower deformed and sullied patiently gave up their quiet being and unless i now confound my present feelings with the past ere from the mutilated bower i turned exulting rich beyond the wealth of kings i felt a sense of pain when i beheld the silent trees and saw the intruding sky then dearest maiden move along these shades in gentleness of heart with gentle hand touchfor there is a spirit in the woods
