when my mother died i was very young and my father sold me while yet my tongue could scarcely cry  weep weep weep weep so your chimneys i sweep amp in soot i sleep  theres little tom dacre who cried when his head that curled like a lambs back was shaved so i said hush tom never mind it for when your heads bare you know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair  and so he was quiet amp that very night as tom was asleeping he had such a sight that thousands of sweepers dick joe ned amp jack were all of them locked up in coffins of black  and by came an angel who had a bright key and he opened the coffins amp set them all free then down a green plain leaping laughing they run and wash in a river and shine in the sun  then naked amp white all their bags left behind they rise upon clouds and sport in the wind and the angel told tom if hed be a good boy hed have god for his father amp never want joy  and so tom awoke and we rose in the dark and got with our bags amp our brushes to work though the morning was cold tom was happy amp warm so if all do their duty they need not fear harm
