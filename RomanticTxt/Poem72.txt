the cold earth slept below above the cold sky shone and all around with a chilling sound from caves of ice and fields of snow the breath of night like death did flow beneath the sinking moon  the wintry hedge was black the green grass was not seen the birds did rest on the bare thorns breast whose roots beside the pathway track had bound their folds oer many a crack which the frost had made between  thine eyes glowd in the glare of the moons dying light as a fenfires beam on a sluggish stream gleams dimlyso the moon shone there and it yellowd the strings of thy tangled hair that shook in the wind of night  the moon made thy lips pale beloved the wind made thy bosom chill the night did shed on thy dear head its frozen dew and thou didst lie where the bitter breath of the naked sky might visit thee at will
