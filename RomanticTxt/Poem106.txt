when first descending from the moorlands i saw the stream of yarrow glide along a bare and open valley the ettrick shepherd was my guide  when last along its banks i wandered through groves that had begun to shed their golden leaves upon the pathways my steps the borderminstrel led  the mighty minstrel breathes no longer mid mouldering ruins low he lies and death upon the braes of yarrow has closed the shepherdpoets eyes  nor has the rolling year twice measured from sign to sign its stedfast course since every mortal power of coleridge was frozen at its marvellous source  the rapt one of the godlike forehead the heaveneyed creature sleeps in earth and lamb the frolic and the gentle has vanished from his lonely hearth  like clouds that rake the mountainsummits or waves that own no curbing hand how fast has brother followed brother from sunshine to the sunless land  yet i whose lids from infant slumber were earlier raised remain to hear a timid voice that asks in whispers who next will drop and disappear  our haughty life is crowned with darkness like london with its own black wreath on which with thee o crabbe forthlooking i gazed from hampsteads breezy heath  as if but yesterday departed thou too art gone before but why oer ripe fruit seasonably gathered should frail survivors heave a sigh  mourn rather for that holy spirit sweet as the spring as ocean deep for her who ere her summer faded has sunk into a breathless sleep  no more of old romantic sorrows for slaughtered youth or lovelorn maid with sharper grief is yarrow smitten and ettrick mourns with her their poet dead
