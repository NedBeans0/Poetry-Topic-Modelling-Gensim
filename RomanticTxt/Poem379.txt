theres more in words than i can teach yet listen child  i would not preach but only give some plain directions to guide your speech and your affections say not you love a roasted fowl but you may love a screaming owl and if you can the unwieldy toad that crawls from his secure abode within the mossy garden wall when evening dews begin to fall oh mark the beauty of his eye what wonders in that circle lie so clear so bright our fathers said he wears a jewel in his head and when upon some showery day into a path or public way a frog leaps out from bordering grass startling the timid as they pass do you observe him and endeavour to take the intruder into favour learning from him to find a reason for a light heart in a dull season and you may love him in the pool that is for him a happy school in which he swims as taught by nature fit pattern for a human creature glancing amid the water bright and sending upward sparkling light  nor blush if oer your heart be stealing a love for things that have no feeling the springs first rose by you espied may fill your breast with joyful pride and you may love the strawberryflower and love the strawberry in its bower but when the fruit so often praised for beauty to your lip is raised say not you love the delicate treat but like it enjoy it and thankfully eat  long may you love your pensioner mouse though one of a tribe that torment the house nor dislike for her cruel sport the cat deadly foe both of mouse and rat remember she follows the law of her kind and instinct is neither wayward nor blind then think of her beautiful gliding form her tread that would scarcely crush a worm and her soothing song by the winter fire soft as the dying throb of the lyre  i would not circumscribe your love it may soar with the eagle and brood with the dove may pierce the earth with the patient mole or track the hedgehog to his hole loving and liking are the solace of life rock the cradle of joy smooth the deathbed of strife you love your father and your mother your grownup and your baby brother you love your sister and your friends and countless blessings which god sends and while these right affections play you live each moment of your day they lead you on to full content and likings fresh and innocent that store the mind the memory feed and prompt to many a gentle deed but likings come and pass away tis love that remains till our latest day our heavenward guide is holy love and will be our bliss with saints above
