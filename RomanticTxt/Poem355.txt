in early youths unclouded scene the brilliant morning of eighteen with health and sprightly joy elate we gazed on youths enchanting spring nor thought how quickly time would bring the mournful period  thirtyeight   then the starch maid or matron sage already of the sober age we viewed with mingled scorn and hate in whose sharp words or sharper face with thoughtless mirth we loved to trace the sad effects of  thirtyeight   till saddening sickening at the view we learned to dread what time might do and then preferred a prayer to fate to end our days ere that arrived when power and pleasure long survived we meet neglect and  thirtyeight   but time in spite of wishes flies and fate our simple prayer denies and bids us deaths own hour await the auburn locks are mixed with grey the transient roses fade away but reason comes at  thirtyeight   her voice the anguish contradicts that dying vanity inflicts her hand new pleasures can create for us she opens to the view prospect less bright  but far more true and bids us smile at  thirtyeight   no more shall scandals breath destroy the social converse we enjoy with bard or critic tete a tete  oer youths bright blooms her blight shall pour but spare the improving friendly hour which science gives at  thirtyeight   stripped of their gaudy hues by truth we view the glittering toys of youth and blush to think how poor the bait for which to public scenes we ran and scorned of sober sense the plan which gives content at  thirtyeight   o may her blessings now arise like stars that mildly light the skies when the suns ardent rays abate and in the luxuries of mind  in friendship science  may we find increasing joys at  thirtyeight   though times inexorable sway has torn the myrtle bands away for other wreaths  tis not too late the amaranths purple glow survives and still minervas olive thrives on the calm brow of  thirtyeight   with eye more steady we engage to contemplate approaching age and life more justly estimate with firmer souls and stronger powers with reason faith and friendship ours well not regret the stealing hours that lead from thirty een to fortyeight
