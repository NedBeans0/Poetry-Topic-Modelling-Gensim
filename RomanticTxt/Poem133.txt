there was a roaring in the wind all night the rain came heavily and fell in floods but now the sun is rising calm and bright the birds are singing in the distant woods over his own sweet voice the stockdove broods the jay makes answer as the magpie chatters and all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters  all things that love the sun are out of doors the sky rejoices in the mornings birth the grass is bright with raindropson the moors the hare is running races in her mirth and with her feet she from the plashy earth raises a mist that glittering in the sun runs with her all the way wherever she doth run  i was a traveller then upon the moor i saw the hare that raced about with joy i heard the woods and distant waters roar or heard them not as happy as a boy the pleasant season did my heart employ my old remembrances went from me wholly and all the ways of men so vain and melancholy  but as it sometimes chanceth from the might of joys in minds that can no further go as high as we have mounted in delight in our dejection do we sink as low to me that morning did it happen so and fears and fancies thick upon me came dim sadnessand blind thoughts i knew not nor could name  i heard the skylark warbling in the sky and i bethought me of the playful hare even such a happy child of earth am i even as these blissful creatures do i fare far from the world i walk and from all care but there may come another day to me solitude pain of heart distress and poverty  my whole life i have lived in pleasant thought as if lifes business were a summer mood as if all needful things would come unsought to genial faith still rich in genial good but how can he expect that others should build for him sow for him and at his call love him who for himself will take no heed at all  i thought of chatterton the marvellous boy the sleepless soul that perished in his pride of him who walked in glory and in joy following his plough along the mountainside by our own spirits are we deified we poets in our youth begin in gladness but thereof come in the end despondency and madness  now whether it were by peculiar grace a leading from above a something given yet it befell that in this lonely place when i with these untoward thoughts had striven beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven i saw a man before me unawares the oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs  as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie couched on the bald top of an eminence wonder to all who do the same espy by what means it could thither come and whence so that it seems a thing endued with sense like a seabeast crawled forth that on a shelf of rock or sand reposeth there to sun itself  such seemed this man not all alive nor dead nor all asleepin his extreme old age his body was bent double feet and head coming together in lifes pilgrimage as if some dire constraint of pain or rage of sickness felt by him in times long past a more than human weight upon his frame had cast  himself he propped limbs body and pale face upon a long grey staff of shaven wood and still as i drew near with gentle pace upon the margin of that moorish flood motionless as a cloud the old man stood that heareth not the loud winds when they call and moveth all together if it move at all  at length himself unsettling he the pond stirred with his staff and fixedly did look upon the muddy water which he conned as if he had been reading in a book and now a strangers privilege i took and drawing to his side to him did say this morning gives us promise of a glorious day  a gentle answer did the old man make in courteous speech which forth he slowly drew and him with further words i thus bespake what occupation do you there pursue this is a lonesome place for one like you ere he replied a flash of mild surprise broke from the sable orbs of his yetvivid eyes  his words came feebly from a feeble chest but each in solemn order followed each with something of a lofty utterance drest choice word and measured phrase above the reach of ordinary men a stately speech such as grave livers do in scotland use religious men who give to god and man their dues  he told that to these waters he had come to gather leeches being old and poor employment hazardous and wearisome and he had many hardships to endure from pond to pond he roamed from moor to moor housing with gods good help by choice or chance and in this way he gained an honest maintenance  the old man still stood talking by my side but now his voice to me was like a stream scarce heard nor word from word could i divide and the whole body of the man did seem like one whom i had met with in a dream or like a man from some far region sent to give me human strength by apt admonishment  my former thoughts returned the fear that kills and hope that is unwilling to be fed cold pain and labour and all fleshly ills and mighty poets in their misery dead perplexed and longing to be comforted my question eagerly did i renew how is it that you live and what is it you do  he with a smile did then his words repeat and said that gathering leeches far and wide he travelled stirring thus about his feet the waters of the pools where they abide once i could meet with them on every side but they have dwindled long by slow decay yet still i persevere and find them where i may  while he was talking thus the lonely place the old mans shape and speechall troubled me in my minds eye i seemed to see him pace about the weary moors continually wandering about alone and silently while i these thoughts within myself pursued he having made a pause the same discourse renewed  and soon with this he other matter blended cheerfully uttered with demeanour kind but stately in the main and when he ended i could have laughed myself to scorn to find in that decrepit man so firm a mind god said i be my help and stay secure ill think of the leechgatherer on the lonely moor
