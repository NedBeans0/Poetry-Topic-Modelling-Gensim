so well go no more a roving so late into the night though the heart be still as loving and the moon be still as bright  for the sword outwears its sheath and the soul wears out the breast and the heart must pause to breathe and love itself have rest  though the night was made for loving and the day returns too soon yet well go no more a roving by the light of the moon
