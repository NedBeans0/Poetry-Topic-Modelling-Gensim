addressed to charles lamb of the india house london well they are gone and here must i remain this limetree bower my prison i have lost beauties and feelings such as would have been most sweet to my remembrance even when age had dimmd mine eyes to blindness they meanwhile friends whom i never more may meet again on springy heath along the hilltop edge wander in gladness and wind down perchance to that still roaring dell of which i told the roaring dell oerwooded narrow deep and only speckled by the midday sun where its slim trunk the ash from rock to rock flings arching like a bridgethat branchless ash unsunnd and damp whose few poor yellow leaves neer tremble in the gale yet tremble still fannd by the waterfall and there my friends behold the dark green file of long lank weeds that all at once a most fantastic sight still nod and drip beneath the dripping edge of the blue claystone  now my friends emerge beneath the wide wide heavenand view again the manysteepled tract magnificent of hilly fields and meadows and the sea with some fair bark perhaps whose sails light up the slip of smooth clear blue betwixt two isles of purple shadow yes they wander on in gladness all but thou methinks most glad my gentlehearted charles for thou hast pined and hungerd after nature many a year in the great city pent winning thy way with sad yet patient soul through evil and pain and strange calamity ah slowly sink behind the western ridge thou glorious sun shine in the slant beams of the sinking orb ye purple heathflowers richlier burn ye clouds live in the yellow light ye distant groves and kindle thou blue ocean so my friend struck with deep joy may stand as i have stood silent with swimming sense yea gazing round on the wide landscape gaze till all doth seem less gross than bodily and of such hues as veil the almighty spirit when yet he makes spirits perceive his presence  a delight comes sudden on my heart and i am glad as i myself were there nor in this bower this little limetree bower have i not markd much that has soothd me pale beneath the blaze hung the transparent foliage and i watchd some broad and sunny leaf and lovd to see the shadow of the leaf and stem above dappling its sunshine and that walnuttree was richly tingd and a deep radiance lay full on the ancient ivy which usurps those fronting elms and now with blackest mass makes their dark branches gleam a lighter hue through the late twilight and though now the bat wheels silent by and not a swallow twitters yet still the solitary humblebee sings in the beanflower henceforth i shall know that nature neer deserts the wise and pure no plot so narrow be but nature there no waste so vacant but may well employ each faculty of sense and keep the heart awake to love and beauty and sometimes tis well to be bereft of promisd good that we may lift the soul and contemplate with lively joy the joys we cannot share my gentlehearted charles when the last rook beat its straight path along the dusky air homewards i blest it deeming its black wing now a dim speck now vanishing in light had crossd the mighty orbs dilated glory while thou stoodst gazing or when all was still flew creeking oer thy head and had a charm for thee my gentlehearted charles to whom no sound is dissonant which tells of life
