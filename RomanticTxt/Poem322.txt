i  no riches from his scanty store my lover could impart he gave a boon i valued more  he gave me all his heart  ii  his soul sincere his generous worth might well this bosom move and when i asked for bliss on earth i only meant his love  iii  but now for me in search of gain from shore to shore he flies why wander riches to obtain when love is all i prize  iv  the frugal meal the lowly cot if blest my love with thee that simple fare that humble lot were more than wealth to me  v  while he the dangerous ocean braves my tears but vainly flow is pity in the faithless waves to which i pour my woe  vi  the night is dark the waters deep yet soft the billows roll alas at every breeze i weep  the storm is in my soul
