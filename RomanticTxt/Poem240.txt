now swarthy summer by rude health embrowned precedence takes of rosy fingered spring and laughing joy with wild flowers prankd and crownd a wild and giddy thing and health robust from every care unbound come on the zephyrs wing and cheer the toiling clown  happy as holidayenjoying face loud tongued and merry as a marriage bell thy lightsome step sheds joy in every place and where the troubled dwell thy witching charms wean them of half their cares and from thy sunny spell they greet joy unawares  then with thy sultry locks all loose and rude and mantle laced with gems of garish light come as of wont for i would fain intrude and in the worlds despite share the rude wealth that thy own heart beguiles if haply so i might win pleasure from thy smiles  me not the noise of brawling pleasure cheers in nightly revels or in city streets but joys which soothe and not distract the ears that one at leisure meets in the green woods and meadows summershorn or fields where beefly greets the ear with mellow horn  the greenswathed grasshopper on treble pipe sings there and dances in madhearted pranks there bees go courting every flower thats ripe on baulks and sunny banks and droning dragonfly on rude bassoon attempts to give god thanks in no discordant tune  the speckled thrush by selfdelight embued there sings unto himself for joys amends and drinks the honey dew of solitude there happiness attends with inbred joy until the heart oerflow of which the worlds rude friends nought heeding nothing know  there the gay river laughing as it goes plashes with easy wave its flaggy sides and to the calm of heart in calmness shows what pleasure there abides to trace its sedgy banks from trouble free spots solitude provides to muse and happy be  there ruminating neath some pleasant bush on sweet silk grass i stretch me at mine ease where i can pillow on the yielding rush and acting as i please drop into pleasant dreams or musing lie mark the windshaken trees and cloudbetravelled sky  there think me how some barter joy for care and waste lifes summerhealth in riot rude of nature nor of natures sweets aware when passions vain intrude these by calm musings softened are and still and the hearts better mood feels sick of doing ill  there i can live and at my leisure seek joys far from cold restraintsnot fearing pride free as the winds that breathe upon my cheek rude health so long denied here poor integrity can sit at ease and list selfsatisfied the song of honeybees  the green lane now i traverse where it goes nought guessing till some sudden turn espies rude batterd finger post that stooping shows where the snug mystery lies and then a mossy spire with ivy crown cheers up the short surprise and shows a peeping town  i see the wild flowers in their summer morn of beauty feeding on joys luscious hours the gay convolvulus wreathing round the thorn agape for honey showers and slender kingcup burnished with the dew of mornings early hours like gold yminted new  and mark by rustic bridge oer shallow stream cowtending boy to toil unreconciled absorbed as in some vagrant summer dream who now in gestures wild starts dancing to his shadow on the wall feeling selfgratified nor fearing human thrall  or thread the sunny valley laced with streams or forests rude and the oershadowd brims of simple ponds where idle shepherd dreams stretching his listless limbs or trace hayscented meadows smooth and long where joys wild impulse swims in one continued song  i love at early morn from new mown swath to see the startled frog his route pursue to mark while leaping oer the dripping path his bright sides scatter dew the early lark that from its bustle flies to hail his matin new and watch him to the skies  to note on hedgerow baulks in moisture sprent the jetty snail creep from the mossy thorn with earnest heed and tremulous intent frail brother of the morn that from the tiny bents dewmisted leaves withdraws his timid horn and fearful vision weaves  or swallow heed on smoketanned chimney top wont to be first unsealing mornings eye ere yet the bee hath gleaned one wayward drop of honey on his thigh to see him seek morns airy couch to sing until the golden sky bepaint his russet wing  or sauntering boy by tanning corn to spy with clapping noise to startle birds away and hear him bawl to every passer by to know the hour of day while the uncradled breezes fresh and strong with waking blossoms play and breathe Ã¦olian song  i love the southwest wind or low or loud and not the less when sudden drops of rain moisten my glowing cheek from ebon cloud threatening soft showers again that over lands new ploughed and meadow grounds summers sweet breath unchain and wake harmonious sounds  rich music breathes in summers every sound and in her harmony of varied greens woods meadows hedgerows cornfields all around much beauty intervenes filling with harmony the ear and eye while oer the mingling scenes far spreads the laughing sky  see how the windenamoured aspen leaves turn up their silver lining to the sun and hark the rustling noise that oft deceives and makes the sheepboy run the sound so mimics fastapproaching showers he thinks the rains begun and hastes to sheltering bowers  but now the evening curdles dank and grey changing her watchet hue for sombre weed and moping owls to close the lids of day on drowsy wing proceed while chickering crickets tremulous and long lights farewell inly heed and give it parting song  the pranking bat its flighty circlet makes the glowworm burnishes its lamp anew oer meadows dewbesprent the beetle wakes inquiries ever new teazing each passing ear with murmurs vain as wanting to pursue his homeward path again  hark tis the melody of distant bells that on the wind with pleasing hum rebounds by fitful starts then musically swells oer the dim stilly grounds while on the meadowbridge the pausing boy listens the mellow sounds and hums in vacant joy  now homewardbound the hedger bundles round his evening faggot and with every stride his leathern doublet leaves a rustling sound till silly sheep beside his path start tremulous and once again look back dissatisfied and scour the dewy plain  how sweet the soothing calmness that distills oer the hearts every sense its opiate dews in meekeyed moods and ever balmy trills that softens and subdues with gentle quiets bland and sober train which dreamy eve renews in many a mellow strain  i love to walk the fields they are to me a legacy no evil can destroy they like a spell set every rapture free that cheerd me when a boy playpastimeall times blotting pen conceald comes like a newborn joy to greet me in the field  for natures objects ever harmonize with emulous taste that vulgar deed annoys which loves in pensive moods to sympathize and meet vibrating joys oer natures pleasing things nor slighting deems pastimes the muse employs vain and obtrusive themes
