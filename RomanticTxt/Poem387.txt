twinkle twinkle little star how i wonder what you are up above the world so high like a diamond in the sky  when the blazing sun is gone when he nothing shines upon then you show your little light twinkle twinkle all the night  then the traveler in the dark thanks you for your tiny spark how could he see where to go if you did not twinkle so  in the dark blue sky you keep often through my curtains peep for you never shut your eye till the sun is in the sky  as your bright and tiny spark lights the traveler in the dark though i know not what you are twinkle twinkle little star
