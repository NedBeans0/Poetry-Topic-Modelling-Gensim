oh hope thou soother sweet of human woes how shall i lure thee to my haunts forlorn for me wilt thou renew the withered rose and clear my painful path of pointed thorn ah come sweet nymph in smiles and softness drest like the young hours that lead the tender year enchantress come and charm my cares to rest alas the flatterer flies and will not hear a prey to fear anxiety and pain must i a sad existence still deplore lo the flowers fade but all the thorns remain for me the vernal garland blooms no more come then pale miserys love be thou my cure and i will bless thee who though slow art sure
