i hid my love when young till i couldnt bear the buzzing of a fly i hid my love to my despite till i could not bear to look at light i dare not gaze upon her face but left her memory in each place whereer i saw a wild flower lie i kissed and bade my love goodbye  i met her in the greenest dells where dewdrops pearl the wood bluebells the lost breeze kissed her bright blue eye the bee kissed and went singing by a sunbeam found a passage there a gold chain round her neck so fair as secret as the wild bees song she lay there all the summer long  i hid my love in field and town till een the breeze would knock me down the bees seemed singing ballads oer the flys bass turned a lions roar and even silence found a tongue to haunt me all the summer long the riddle nature could not prove was nothing else but secret love
