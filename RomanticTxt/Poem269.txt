animula vagula blandula life i know not what thou art but know that thou and i must part and when or how or where we met i own to mes a secret yet but this i know when thou art fled whereer they lay these limbs this head no clod so valueless shall be as all that then remains of me o whither whither dost thou fly where bend unseen thy trackless course and in this strange divorce ah tell where i must seek this compound i  to the vast ocean of empyreal flame from whence thy essence came dost thou thy flight pursue when freed from matters base encumbering weed or dost thou hid from sight wait like some spellbound knight through blank oblivious years th appointed hour to break thy trance and reassume thy power yet canst thou without thought or feeling be o say what art thou when no more thou rt thee  life weve been long together through pleasant and through cloudy weather tis hard to part when friends are dear perhaps t will cost a sigh a tear then steal away give little warning choose thine own time say not good night but in some brighter clime bid me good morning
