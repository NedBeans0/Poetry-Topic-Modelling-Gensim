my hair is grey but not with years nor grew it white in a single night as mens have grown from sudden fears my limbs are bowd though not with toil but rusted with a vile repose for they have been a dungeons spoil and mine has been the fate of those to whom the goodly earth and air are bannd and barrdforbidden fare but this was for my fathers faith i sufferd chains and courted death that father perishd at the stake for tenets he would not forsake and for the same his lineal race in darkness found a dwelling place we were sevenwho now are one six in youth and one in age finishd as they had begun proud of persecutions rage one in fire and two in field their belief with blood have seald dying as their father died for the god their foes denied three were in a dungeon cast of whom this wreck is left the last  there are seven pillars of gothic mould in chillons dungeons deep and old there are seven columns massy and grey dim with a dull imprisond ray a sunbeam which hath lost its way and through the crevice and the cleft of the thick wall is fallen and left creeping oer the floor so damp like a marshs meteor lamp and in each pillar there is a ring and in each ring there is a chain that iron is a cankering thing for in these limbs its teeth remain with marks that will not wear away till i have done with this new day which now is painful to these eyes which have not seen the sun so rise for yearsi cannot count them oer i lost their long and heavy score when my last brother droopd and died and i lay living by his side  they chaind us each to a column stone and we were threeyet each alone we could not move a single pace we could not see each others face but with that pale and livid light that made us strangers in our sight and thus togetheryet apart fetterd in hand but joind in heart twas still some solace in the dearth of the pure elements of earth to hearken to each others speech and each turn comforter to each with some new hope or legend old or song heroically bold but even these at length grew cold our voices took a dreary tone an echo of the dungeon stone a grating sound not full and free as they of yore were wont to be it might be fancybut to me they never sounded like our own  i was the eldest of the three and to uphold and cheer the rest i ought to doand did my best and each did well in his degree the youngest whom my father loved because our mothers brow was given to him with eyes as blue as heaven for him my soul was sorely moved and truly might it be distressd to see such bird in such a nest for he was beautiful as day when day was beautiful to me as to young eagles being free a polar day which will not see a sunset till its summers gone its sleepless summer of long light the snowclad offspring of the sun and thus he was as pure and bright and in his natural spirit gay with tears for nought but others ills and then they flowd like mountain rills unless he could assuage the woe which he abhorrd to view below  the other was as pure of mind but formd to combat with his kind strong in his frame and of a mood which gainst the world in war had stood and perishd in the foremost rank with joybut not in chains to pine his spirit witherd with their clank i saw it silently decline and so perchance in sooth did mine but yet i forced it on to cheer those relics of a home so dear he was a hunter of the hills had followed there the deer and wolf to him this dungeon was a gulf and fetterd feet the worst of ills  lake leman lies by chillons walls a thousand feet in depth below its massy waters meet and flow thus much the fathomline was sent from chillons snowwhite battlement which round about the wave inthralls a double dungeon wall and wave have madeand like a living grave below the surface of the lake the dark vault lies wherein we lay we heard it ripple night and day sounding oer our heads it knockd and i have felt the winters spray wash through the bars when winds were high and wanton in the happy sky and then the very rock hath rockd and i have felt it shake unshockd because i could have smiled to see the death that would have set me free  i said my nearer brother pined i said his mighty heart declined he loathed and put away his food it was not that twas coarse and rude for we were used to hunters fare and for the like had little care the milk drawn from the mountain goat was changed for water from the moat our bread was such as captives tears have moistend many a thousand years since man first pent his fellow men like brutes within an iron den but what were these to us or him these wasted not his heart or limb my brothers soul was of that mould which in a palace had grown cold had his free breathing been denied the range of the steep mountains side but why delay the truthhe died i saw and could not hold his head nor reach his dying handnor dead though hard i strove but strove in vain to rend and gnash my bonds in twain he diedand they unlockd his chain and scoopd for him a shallow grave even from the cold earth of our cave i beggd them as a boon to lay his corse in dust whereon the day might shineit was a foolish thought but then within my brain it wrought that even in death his freeborn breast in such a dungeon could not rest i might have spared my idle prayer they coldly laughdand laid him there the flat and turfless earth above the being we so much did love his empty chain above it leant such murders fitting monument  but he the favourite and the flower most cherishd since his natal hour his mothers image in fair face the infant love of all his race his martyrd fathers dearest thought my latest care for whom i sought to hoard my life that his might be less wretched now and one day free he too who yet had held untired a spirit natural or inspired he too was struck and day by day was witherd on the stalk away oh god it is a fearful thing to see the human soul take wing in any shape in any mood ive seen it rushing forth in blood ive seen it on the breaking ocean strive with a swoln convulsive motion ive seen the sick and ghastly bed of sin delirious with its dread but these were horrorsthis was woe unmixd with suchbut sure and slow he faded and so calm and meek so softly worn so sweetly weak so tearless yet so tenderkind and grieved for those he left behind with all the while a cheek whose bloom was as a mockery of the tomb whose tints as gently sunk away as a departing rainbows ray an eye of most transparent light that almost made the dungeon bright and not a word of murmurnot a groan oer his untimely lot a little talk of better days a little hope my own to raise for i was sunk in silencelost in this last loss of all the most and then the sighs he would suppress of fainting natures feebleness more slowly drawn grew less and less i listend but i could not hear i calld for i was wild with fear i knew twas hopeless but my dread would not be thus admonishèd i calld and thought i heard a sound i burst my chain with one strong bound and rushed to himi found him not i only stirred in this black spot i only lived i only drew the accursed breath of dungeondew the last the sole the dearest link between me and the eternal brink which bound me to my failing race was broken in this fatal place one on the earth and one beneath my brothersboth had ceased to breathe i took that hand which lay so still alas my own was full as chill i had not strength to stir or strive but felt that i was still alive a frantic feeling when we know that what we love shall neer be so i know not why i could not die i had no earthly hopebut faith and that forbade a selfish death  what next befell me then and there i know not welli never knew first came the loss of light and air and then of darkness too i had no thought no feelingnone among the stones i stood a stone and was scarce conscious what i wist as shrubless crags within the mist for all was blank and bleak and grey it was not nightit was not day it was not even the dungeonlight so hateful to my heavy sight but vacancy absorbing space and fixednesswithout a place there were no stars no earth no time no check no change no good no crime but silence and a stirless breath which neither was of life nor death a sea of stagnant idleness blind boundless mute and motionless a light broke in upon my brain it was the carol of a bird it ceased and then it came again the sweetest song ear ever heard and mine was thankful till my eyes ran over with the glad surprise and they that moment could not see i was the mate of misery but then by dull degrees came back my senses to their wonted track i saw the dungeon walls and floor close slowly round me as before i saw the glimmer of the sun creeping as it before had done but through the crevice where it came that bird was perchd as fond and tame and tamer than upon the tree a lovely bird with azure wings and song that said a thousand things and seemed to say them all for me i never saw its like before i neer shall see its likeness more it seemd like me to want a mate but was not half so desolate and it was come to love me when none lived to love me so again and cheering from my dungeons brink had brought me back to feel and think i know not if it late were free or broke its cage to perch on mine but knowing well captivity sweet bird i could not wish for thine or if it were in wingèd guise a visitant from paradise forheaven forgive that thought the while which made me both to weep and smile i sometimes deemd that it might be my brothers soul come down to me but then at last away it flew and then twas mortal well i knew for he would never thus have flown and left me twice so doubly lone lone as the corse within its shroud lone as a solitary cloud a single cloud on a sunny day while all the rest of heaven is clear a frown upon the atmosphere that hath no business to appear when skies are blue and earth is gay  a kind of change came in my fate my keepers grew compassionate i know not what had made them so they were inured to sights of woe but so it wasmy broken chain with links unfastend did remain and it was liberty to stride along my cell from side to side and up and down and then athwart and tread it over every part and round the pillars one by one returning where my walk begun avoiding only as i trod my brothers graves without a sod for if i thought with heedless tread my step profaned their lowly bed my breath came gaspingly and thick and my crushd heart felt blind and sick i made a footing in the wall it was not therefrom to escape for i had buried one and all who loved me in a human shape and the whole earth would henceforth be a wider prison unto me no child no sire no kin had i no partner in my misery i thought of this and i was glad for thought of them had made me mad but i was curious to ascend to my barrd windows and to bend once more upon the mountains high the quiet of a loving eye  i saw themand they were the same they were not changed like me in frame i saw their thousand years of snow on hightheir wide long lake below and the blue rhone in fullest flow i heard the torrents leap and gush oer channelld rock and broken bush i saw the whitewalld distant town and whiter sails go skimming down and then there was a little isle which in my very face did smile the only one in view a small green isle it seemd no more scarce broader than my dungeon floor but in it there were three tall trees and oer it blew the mountain breeze and by it there were waters flowing and on it there were young flowers growing of gentle breath and hue the fish swam by the castle wall and they seemd joyous each and all the eagle rode the rising blast methought he never flew so fast as then to me he seemd to fly and then new tears came in my eye and i felt troubledand would fain i had not left my recent chain and when i did descend again the darkness of my dim abode fell on me as a heavy load it was as is a newdug grave closing oer one we sought to save and yet my glance too much opprest had almost need of such a rest  it might be months or years or days i kept no count i took no note i had no hope my eyes to raise and clear them of their dreary mote at last men came to set me free i askd not why and reckd not where it was at length the same to me fetterd or fetterless to be i learnd to love despair and thus when they appeard at last and all my bonds aside were cast these heavy walls to me had grown a hermitageand all my own and half i felt as they were come to tear me from a second home with spiders i had friendship made and watchd them in their sullen trade had seen the mice by moonlight play and why should i feel less than they we were all inmates of one place and i the monarch of each race had power to killyet strange to tell in quiet we had learnd to dwell my very chains and i grew friends so much a long communion tends to make us what we areeven i regaind my freedom with a sigh
