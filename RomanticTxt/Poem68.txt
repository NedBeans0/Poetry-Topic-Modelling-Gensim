i arise from dreams of thee in the first sweet sleep of night when the winds are breathing low and the stars are shining bright i arise from dreams of thee and a spirit in my feet hath led mewho knows how to thy chamber window sweet  the wandering airs they faint on the dark the silent stream the champak odours fail like sweet thoughts in a dream the nightingales complaint it dies upon her heart as i must on thine oh belov√®d as thou art  oh lift me from the grass i die i faint i fail let thy love in kisses rain on my lips and eyelids pale my cheek is cold and white alas my heart beats loud and fast oh press it to thine own again where it will break at last
