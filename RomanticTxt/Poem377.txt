what way does the wind come what way does he go he rides over the water and over the snow through wood and through vale and oer rocky height which the goat cannot climb takes his sounding flight he tosses about in every bare tree as if you look up you plainly may see but how he will come and whither he goes theres never a scholar in england knows  he will suddenly stop in a cunning nook and ring a sharp larum but if you should look theres nothing to see but a cushion of snow round as a pillow and whiter than milk and softer than if it were covered with silk sometimes hell hide in the cave of a rock then whistle as shrill as the buzzard cock  yet seek him and what shall you find in the place nothing but silence and empty space save in a corner a heap of dry leaves that hes left for a bed to beggars or thieves  as soon as tis daylight tomorrow with me you shall go to the orchard and then you will see that he has been there and made a great rout and cracked the branches and strewn them about heaven grant that he spare but that one upright twig that looked up at the sky so proud and big all last summer as well you know studded with apples a beautiful show  hark over the roof he makes a pause and growls as if he would fix his claws right in the slates and with a huge rattle drive them down like men in a battle  but let him range round he does us no harm we build up the fire were snug and warm untouched by his breath see the candle shines bright and burns with a clear and steady light  books have we to read but that halfstifled knell alas tis the sound of the eight oclock bell  come now well to bed and when we are there he may work his own will and what shall we care he may knock at the door  well not let him in may drive at the windows  well laugh at his din let him seek his own home wherever it be heres a cozie warm house for edward and me
