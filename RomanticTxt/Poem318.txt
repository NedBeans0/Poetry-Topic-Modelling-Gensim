what voice is this thou evening gale that mingles with thy rising wail and as it passes sadly seems the faint return of youthful dreams  though now its strain is wild and drear blithe was it once as skylarks cheer  sweet as the nightbirds sweetest song  dear as the lisp of infants tongue  it was the voice at whose sweet flow the heart did beat and cheek did glow and lip did smile and eye did weep and motioned love the measure keep  oft be thy sound soft gale of even thus to my wistful fancy given and as i list the swelling strain the dead shall seem to live again
