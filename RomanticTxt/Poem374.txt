ye tender young virgins attend to my lay my heart is divided in twain my collin is beautiful witty and gay and damons a kindhearted swain  whenever my lovely young collin i meet what pleasures arise in my breast the dear gentle swain looks so charming and sweet i fancy i love him the best  but when my dear damon does to me complain so tender so loving and kind my bosom is softened to hear the fond swain and collin slips out of my mind  whenever my damon repeats his soft tale my heart overflows with delight but when my dear collin appears in the vale i languish away at the sight  tis collin alone shall possess my fond heart now damon for ever adieu but can i  i cannot from damon thus part hes loved me so long and so true  my heart to my damon ill instantly bind and on him will fix all my care but o should i be to my collin unkind he surely will die with despair  how happy how happy with damon id been if collin i never had knew as happy with collin if id never seen my damon so tender and true
