evening as slow thy placid shades descend veiling with gentlest hush the landscape still the lonely battlement the farthest hill and wood i think of those who have no friend who now perhaps by melancholy led from the broad blaze of day where pleasure flaunts retiring wander to the ringdoves haunts unseen and watch the tints that oer thy bed hang lovely oft to musing fancys eye presenting fairy vales where the tird mind might rest beyond the murmurs of mankind nor hear the hourly moans of misery alas for man that hopes fair views the while should smile like you and perish as they smile
