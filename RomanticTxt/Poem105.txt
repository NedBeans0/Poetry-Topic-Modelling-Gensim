i was thy neighbour once thou rugged pile four summer weeks i dwelt in sight of thee i saw thee every day and all the while thy form was sleeping on a glassy sea  so pure the sky so quiet was the air so like so very like was day to day wheneer i looked thy image still was there it trembled but it never passed away  how perfect was the calm it seemed no sleep no mood which season takes away or brings i could have fancied that the mighty deep was even the gentlest of all gentle things  ahthen if mine had been the painters hand to express what then i saw and add the gleam the light that never was on sea or land the consecration and the poets dream  i would have planted thee thou hoary pile amid a world how different from this beside a sea that could not cease to smile on tranquil land beneath a sky of bliss  thou shouldst have seemed a treasurehouse divine of peaceful years a chronicle of heaven of all the sunbeams that did ever shine the very sweetest had to thee been given  a picture had it been of lasting ease elysian quiet without toil or strife no motion but the moving tide a breeze or merely silent natures breathing life  such in the fond illusion of my heart such picture would i at that time have made and seen the soul of truth in every part a steadfast peace that might not be betrayed  so once it would have beentis so no more i have submitted to a new control a power is gone which nothing can restore a deep distress hath humanised my soul  not for a moment could i now behold a smiling sea and be what i have been the feeling of my loss will neer be old this which i know i speak with mind serene  then beaumont friend who would have been the friend if he had lived of him whom i deplore this work of thine i blame not but commend this sea in anger and that dismal shore  o tis a passionate workyet wise and well well chosen is the spirit that is here that hulk which labours in the deadly swell this rueful sky this pageantry of fear  and this huge castle standing here sublime i love to see the look with which it braves cased in the unfeeling armour of old time the lightning the fierce wind the trampling waves  farewell farewell the heart that lives alone housed in a dream at distance from the kind such happiness wherever it be known is to be pitied for tis surely blind  but welcome fortitude and patient cheer and frequent sights of what is to be borne such sights or worse as are before me here not without hope we suffer and we mourn
