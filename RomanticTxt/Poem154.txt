a simple child that lightly draws its breath and feels its life in every limb what should it know of death  i met a little cottage girl she was eight years old she said her hair was thick with many a curl that clustered round her head  she had a rustic woodland air and she was wildly clad her eyes were fair and very fair her beauty made me glad  sisters and brothers little maid how many may you be how many seven in all she said and wondering looked at me  and where are they i pray you tell she answered seven are we and two of us at conway dwell and two are gone to sea  two of us in the churchyard lie my sister and my brother and in the churchyard cottage i dwell near them with my mother  you say that two at conway dwell and two are gone to sea yet ye are seven i pray you tell sweet maid how this may be  then did the little maid reply seven boys and girls are we two of us in the churchyard lie beneath the churchyard tree  you run about my little maid your limbs they are alive if two are in the churchyard laid then ye are only five  their graves are green they may be seen the little maid replied twelve steps or more from my mothers door and they are side by side  my stockings there i often knit my kerchief there i hem and there upon the ground i sit and sing a song to them  and often after sunset sir when it is light and fair i take my little porringer and eat my supper there  the first that died was sister jane in bed she moaning lay till god released her of her pain and then she went away  so in the churchyard she was laid and when the grass was dry together round her grave we played my brother john and i  and when the ground was white with snow and i could run and slide my brother john was forced to go and he lies by her side  how many are you then said i if they two are in heaven quick was the little maids reply o master we are seven  but they are dead those two are dead their spirits are in heaven twas throwing words away for still the little maid would have her will and said nay we are seven
