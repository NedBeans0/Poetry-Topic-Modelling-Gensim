all thoughts all passions all delights whatever stirs this mortal frame all are but ministers of love and feed his sacred flame  oft in my waking dreams do i live oer again that happy hour when midway on the mount i lay beside the ruined tower  the moonshine stealing oer the scene had blended with the lights of eve and she was there my hope my joy my own dear genevieve  she leant against the armed man the statue of the armed knight she stood and listened to my lay amid the lingering light  few sorrows hath she of her own my hope my joy my genevieve she loves me best wheneer i sing the songs that make her grieve  i played a soft and doleful air i sang an old and moving story an old rude song that suited well that ruin wild and hoary  she listened with a flitting blush with downcast eyes and modest grace for well she knew i could not choose but gaze upon her face  i told her of the knight that wore upon his shield a burning brand and that for ten long years he wooed the lady of the land  i told her how he pined and ah the deep the low the pleading tone with which i sang anothers love interpreted my own  she listened with a flitting blush with downcast eyes and modest grace and she forgave me that i gazed too fondly on her face  but when i told the cruel scorn that crazed that bold and lovely knight and that he crossed the mountainwoods nor rested day nor night  that sometimes from the savage den and sometimes from the darksome shade and sometimes starting up at once in green and sunny glade  there came and looked him in the face an angel beautiful and bright and that he knew it was a fiend this miserable knight  and that unknowing what he did he leaped amid a murderous band and saved from outrage worse than death the lady of the land  and how she wept and clasped his knees and how she tended him in vain and ever strove to expiate the scorn that crazed his brain  and that she nursed him in a cave and how his madness went away when on the yellow forestleaves a dying man he lay  his dying wordsbut when i reached that tenderest strain of all the ditty my faltering voice and pausing harp disturbed her soul with pity  all impulses of soul and sense had thrilled my guileless genevieve the music and the doleful tale the rich and balmy eve  and hopes and fears that kindle hope an undistinguishable throng and gentle wishes long subdued subdued and cherished long  she wept with pity and delight she blushed with love and virginshame and like the murmur of a dream i heard her breathe my name  her bosom heavedshe stepped aside as conscious of my look she stepped then suddenly with timorous eye she fled to me and wept  she half enclosed me with her arms she pressed me with a meek embrace and bending back her head looked up and gazed upon my face  twas partly love and partly fear and partly twas a bashful art that i might rather feel than see the swelling of her heart  i calmed her fears and she was calm and told her love with virgin pride and so i won my genevieve my bright and beauteous bride
