a dinner party coffee tea sandwich or supper all may be in their way pleasant but to me not one of these deserves the praise that welcomer of newborn days a breakfast merits ever giving cheerful notice we are living another day refreshed by sleep when its festival we keep now although i would not slight those kindly words we use good night yet parting words are words of sorrow and may not vie with sweet good morrow with which again our friends we greet when in the breakfastroom we meet at the social table round listening to the lively sound of those notes which never tire of urn or kettle on the fire sleepy robert never hears or urn or kettle he appears when all have finished one by one dropping off and breakfast done yet has he too his own pleasure his breakfast hours his hour of leisure and left alone he reads or muses or else in idle mood he uses to sit and watch the venturous fly where the sugars piled high clambering oer the lumps so white rocky cliffs of sweet delight
