composed at clevedon somersetshire my pensive sara thy soft cheek reclined thus on mine arm most soothing sweet it is to sit beside our cot our cot oergrown with whiteflowered jasmin and the broadleaved myrtle meet emblems they of innocence and love and watch the clouds that late were rich with light slow saddening round and mark the star of eve serenely brilliant such would wisdom be shine opposite how exquisite the scents snatched from yon beanfield and the world so hushed the stilly murmur of the distant sea tells us of silence  and that simplest lute placed lengthways in the clasping casement hark how by the desultory breeze caressed like some coy maid half yielding to her lover it pours such sweet upbraiding as must needs tempt to repeat the wrong and now its strings boldlier swept the long sequacious notes over delicious surges sink and rise such a soft floating witchery of sound as twilight elfins make when they at eve voyage on gentle gales from fairyland where melodies round honeydropping flowers footless and wild like birds of paradise nor pause nor perch hovering on untamed wing o the one life within us and abroad which meets all motion and becomes its soul a light in sound a soundlike power in light rhythm in all thought and joyance everywhere methinks it should have been impossible not to love all things in a world so filled where the breeze warbles and the mute still air is music slumbering on her instrument  and thus my love as on the midway slope of yonder hill i stretch my limbs at noon whilst through my halfclosed eyelids i behold the sunbeams dance like diamonds on the main and tranquil muse upon tranquility full many a thought uncalled and undetained and many idle flitting phantasies traverse my indolent and passive brain as wild and various as the random gales that swell and flutter on this subject lute  and what if all of animated nature be but organic harps diversely framed that tremble into thought as oer them sweeps plastic and vast one intellectual breeze at once the soul of each and god of all  but thy more serious eye a mild reproof darts o beloved woman nor such thoughts dim and unhallowed dost thou not reject and biddest me walk humbly with my god meek daughter in the family of christ well hast thou said and holily dispraised these shapings of the unregenerate mind bubbles that glitter as they rise and break on vain philosophys ayebabbling spring for never guiltless may i speak of him the incomprehensible save when with awe i praise him and with faith that inly feels who with his saving mercies heal√®d me a sinful and most miserable man wildered and dark and gave me to possess peace and this cot and thee hearthonored maid
