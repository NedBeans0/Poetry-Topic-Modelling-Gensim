flow gently sweet afton among thy green braes flow gently ill sing thee a song in thy praise my marys asleep by thy murmuring stream flow gently sweet afton disturb not her dream  thou stockdove whose echo resounds thro the glen ye wild whistling blackbirds in yon thorny den thou greencrested lapwing thy screaming forbear i charge you disturb not my slumbering fair  how lofty sweet afton thy neighbouring hills far markd with the courses of clear winding rills there daily i wander as noon rises high my flocks and my marys sweet cot in my eye  how pleasant thy banks and green valleys below where wild in the woodlands the primroses blow there oft as mild evning sweeps over the lea the sweetscented birk shades my mary and me  thy crystal stream afton how lovely it glides and winds by the cot where my mary resides how wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave as gathering sweet flowrets she stems thy clear wave  flow gently sweet afton among thy green braes flow gently sweet river the theme of my lays my marys asleep by thy murmuring stream flow gently sweet afton disturb not her dream
