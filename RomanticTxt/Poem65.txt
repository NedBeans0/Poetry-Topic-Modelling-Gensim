chorus  the worlds great age begins anew the golden years return the earth doth like a snake renew her winter weeds outworn heaven smiles and faiths and empires gleam like wrecks of a dissolving dream  a brighter hellas rears its mountains from waves serener far a new peneus rolls his fountains against the morning star where fairer tempes bloom there sleep young cyclads on a sunnier deep  a loftier argo cleaves the main fraught with a later prize another orpheus sings again and loves and weeps and dies a new ulysses leaves once more calypso for his native shore  oh write no more the tale of troy if earth deaths scroll must be nor mix with laian rage the joy which dawns upon the free although a subtler sphinx renew riddles of death thebes never knew  another athens shall arise and to remoter time bequeath like sunset to the skies the splendour of its prime and leave if nought so bright may live all earth can take or heaven can give  saturn and love their long repose shall burst more bright and good than all who fell than one who rose than many unsubdud not gold not blood their altar dowers but votive tears and symbol flowers  oh cease must hate and death return cease must men kill and die cease drain not to its dregs the urn of bitter prophecy the world is weary of the past oh might it die or rest at last
