here where precipitate spring with one light bound into hot summers lusty arms expires and where go forth at morn at eve at night soft airs that want the lute to play with them and softer sighs that know not what they want under a wall beneath an orangetree whose tallest flowers could tell the lowlier ones of sights in fiesole right up above while i was gazing a few paces off at what they seemed to show me with their nods their frequent whispers and their pointing shoots a gentle maid came down the gardensteps and gathered the pure treasure in her lap i heard the branches rustle and stept forth to drive the ox away or mule or goat such i believed it must be for sweet scents are the swift vehicles of still sweeter thoughts and nurse and pillow the dull memory that would let drop without them her best stores they bring me tales of youth and tones of love and tis and ever was my wish and way to let all flowers live freely and all die wheneer their genius bids their souls depart among their kindred in their native place i never pluck the rose the violets head hath shaken with my breath upon its bank and not reproacht me the eversacred cup of the pure lily hath between my hands felt safe unsoild nor lost one grain of gold i saw the light that made the glossy leaves more glossy the fair arm the fairer cheek warmed by the eye intent on its pursuit i saw the foot that altho halferect from its grey slipper could not lift her up to what she wanted i held down a branch and gatherd her some blossoms since their hour was come and bees had wounded them and flies of harder wing were working their way thro and scattering them in fragments under foot so crisp were some they rattled unevolved others ere broken off fell into shells for such appear the petals when detacht unbending brittle lucid white like snow and like snow not seen thro by eye or sun yet every one her gown received from me was fairer than the first   i thought not so but so she praised them to reward my care i said you find the largest   this indeed  cried she is large and sweet   she held one forth whether for me to look at or to take she knew not nor did i but taking it would best have solved and this she felt her doubts i dared not touch it for it seemed a part of her own self fresh full the most mature of blossoms yet a blossom with a touch to fall and yet unfallen  she drew back the boon she tendered and then finding not the ribbon at her waist to fix it in dropt it as loth to drop it on the rest
