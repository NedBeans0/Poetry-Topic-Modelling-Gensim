high in the breathless hall the minstrel sate and emonts murmur mingled with the song the words of ancient time i thus translate a festal strain that hath been silent long  from town to town from tower to tower the red rose is a gladsome flower her thirty years of winter past the red rose is revived at last she lifts her head for endless spring for everlasting blossoming both roses flourish red and white in love and sisterly delight the two that were at strife are blended and all old troubles now are ended joy joy to both but most to her who is the flower of lancaster behold her how she smiles today on this great throng this bright array fair greeting doth she send to all from every corner of the hall but chiefly from above the board where sits in state our rightful lord a clifford to his own restored  they came with banner spear and shield and it was proved in bosworthfield not long the avenger was withstood earth helped him with the cry of blood st george was for us and the might of blessed angels crowned the right loud voice the land has uttered forth we loudest in the faithful north our fields rejoice our mountains ring our streams proclaim a welcoming our strongabodes and castles see the glory of their loyalty  how glad is skipton at this hour though lonely a deserted tower knight squire and yeoman page and groom we have them at the feast of broughm how glad pendragonthough the sleep of years be on hershe shall reap a taste of this great pleasure viewing as in a dream her own renewing rejoiced is brough right glad i deem beside her little humble stream and she that keepeth watch and ward her statelier edens course to guard they both are happy at this hour though each is but a lonely tower but here is perfect joy and pride for one fair house by emonts side this day distinguished without peer to see her master and to cheer him and his ladymother dear  oh it was a time forlorn when the fatherless was born give her wings that she may fly or she sees her infant die swords that are with slaughter wild hunt the mother and the child who will take them from the light yonder is a man in sight yonder is a housebut where no they must not enter there to the caves and to the brooks to the clouds of heaven she looks she is speechless but her eyes pray in ghostly agonies blissful mary mother mild maid and mother undefiled save a mother and her child  now who is he that bounds with joy on carrocks side a shepherdboy no thoughts hath he but thoughts that pass light as the wind along the grass can this be he who hither came in secret like a smothered flame oer whom such thankful tears were shed for shelter and a poor mans bread god loves the child and god hath willed that those dear words should be fulfilled the ladys words when forced away the last she to her babe did say my own my own thy fellowguest i may not be but rest thee rest for lowly shepherds life is best  alas when evil men are strong no life is good no pleasure long the boy must part from mosedales groves and leave blencatharas rugged coves and quit the flowers that summer brings to glenderamakins lofty springs must vanish and his careless cheer be turned to heaviness and fear give sir lancelot threlkeld praise hear it good man old in days thou tree of covert and of rest for this young bird that is distrest among thy branches safe he lay and he was free to sport and play when falcons were abroad for prey  a recreant harp that sings of fear and heaviness in cliffords ear i said when evil men are strong no life is good no pleasure long a weak and cowardly untruth our clifford was a happy youth and thankful through a weary time that brought him up to manhoods prime again he wanders forth at will and tends a flock from hill to hill his garb is humble neer was seen such garb with such a noble mien among the shepherdgrooms no mate hath he a child of strength and state yet lacks not friends for simple glee nor yet for higher sympathy  to his side the fallowdeer came and rested without fear the eagle lord of land and sea stooped down to pay him fealty and both the undying fish that swim through bowscaletarn did wait on him the pair were servants of his eye in their immortality and glancing gleaming dark or bright moved to and fro for his delight he knew the rocks which angels haunt upon the mountains visitant he hath kenned them taking wing and into caves where faeries sing he hath entered and been told by voices how men lived of old among the heavens his eye can see the face of thing that is to be and if that men report him right his tongue could whisper words of might now another day is come fitter hope and nobler doom he hath thrown aside his crook and hath buried deep his book armour rusting in his halls on the blood of clifford calls quell the scot exclaims the lance bear me to the heart of france is the longing of the shield tell thy name thou trembling field field of death whereer thou be groan thou with our victory happy day and mighty hour when our shepherd in his power mailed and horsed with lance and sword to his ancestors restored like a reappearing star like a glory from afar first shall head the flock of war  alas the impassioned minstrel did not know how by heavens grace this cliffords heart was framed how he long forced in humble walks to go was softened into feeling soothed and tamed  love had he found in huts where poor men lie his daily teachers had been woods and rills the silence that is in the starry sky the sleep that is among the lonely hills  in him the savage virtue of the race revenge and all ferocious thoughts were dead nor did he change but kept in lofty place the wisdom which adversity had bred  glad were the vales and every cottagehearth the shepherdlord was honoured more and more and ages after he was laid in earth the good lord clifford was the name he bore
