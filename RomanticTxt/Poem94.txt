hail to thee blithe spirit bird thou never wert that from heaven or near it pourest thy full heart in profuse strains of unpremeditated art  higher still and higher from the earth thou springest like a cloud of fire the blue deep thou wingest and singing still dost soar and soaring ever singest  in the golden lightning of the sunken sun oer which clouds are brightning thou dost float and run like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun  the pale purple even melts around thy flight like a star of heaven in the broad daylight thou art unseen but yet i hear thy shrill delight  keen as are the arrows of that silver sphere whose intense lamp narrows in the white dawn clear until we hardly see we feel that it is there  all the earth and air with thy voice is loud as when night is bare from one lonely cloud the moon rains out her beams and heaven is overflowd  what thou art we know not what is most like thee from rainbow clouds there flow not drops so bright to see as from thy presence showers a rain of melody  like a poet hidden in the light of thought singing hymns unbidden till the world is wrought to sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not  like a highborn maiden in a palacetower soothing her loveladen soul in secret hour with music sweet as love which overflows her bower  like a glowworm golden in a dell of dew scattering unbeholden its aereal hue among the flowers and grass which screen it from the view  like a rose embowerd in its own green leaves by warm winds deflowerd till the scent it gives makes faint with too much sweet those heavywinged thieves  sound of vernal showers on the twinkling grass rainawakend flowers all that ever was joyous and clear and fresh thy music doth surpass  teach us sprite or bird what sweet thoughts are thine i have never heard praise of love or wine that panted forth a flood of rapture so divine  chorus hymeneal or triumphal chant matchd with thine would be all but an empty vaunt a thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want  what objects are the fountains of thy happy strain what fields or waves or mountains what shapes of sky or plain what love of thine own kind what ignorance of pain  with thy clear keen joyance languor cannot be shadow of annoyance never came near thee thou lovest but neer knew loves sad satiety  waking or asleep thou of death must deem things more true and deep than we mortals dream or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream  we look before and after and pine for what is not our sincerest laughter with some pain is fraught our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought  yet if we could scorn hate and pride and fear if we were things born not to shed a tear i know not how thy joy we ever should come near  better than all measures of delightful sound better than all treasures that in books are found thy skill to poet were thou scorner of the ground  teach me half the gladness that thy brain must know such harmonious madness from my lips would flow the world should listen then as i am listening now
