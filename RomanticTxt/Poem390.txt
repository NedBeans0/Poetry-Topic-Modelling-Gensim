long time a child and still a child when years had painted manhood on my cheek was i for yet i lived like one not born to die a thriftless prodigal of smiles and tears no hope i needed and i knew no fears but sleep though sweet is only sleep and waking i waked to sleep no more at once oertaking the vanguard of my age with all arrears of duty on my back nor child nor man nor youth nor sage i find my head is grey for i have lost the race i never ran a rathe december blights my lagging may and still i am a child tho i be old time is my debtor for my years untold
