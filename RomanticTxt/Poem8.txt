therefore will i leave off metaphysical discussion which is neither here nor there if i agree that what is is then this i call being quite perspicuous and extremely fair the truth is ive grown lately

or seen timbuctoo or hath taken tea in smalleyd chinas crockeryware metropolis or sat amidst the bricks of nineveh may not think much of londons first appearance but ask him what he thinks of it a year hence  viii  don juan had got out on shooters hill sunset the time the place the same declivity which looks along that vale of good and ill where london streets ferment in full activity while everything around was calm and still except the creak of wheels which on their pivot he heard and that beelike bubbling busy hum of cities that boil over with their scum  ix  i say don juan wrappd in contemplation walkd on behind his carriage oer the summit and lost in wonder of so great a nation gave way tot since he could not overcome it and here he cried is freedoms chosen station here peals the peoples voice nor can entomb it racks prisons inquisitions resurrection awaits it each new meeting or election  x  here are chaste wives pure lives her people pay but what they please and if that things be dear tis only that they love to throw away their cash to show how much they have ayear here laws are all inviolate none lay traps for the traveller every highways clear herehe was interrupted by a knife withdamn your eyes your money or your life  xi  these freeborn sounds proceeded from four pads in ambush laid who had perceivd him loiter behind his carriage and like handy lads had seizd the lucky hour to reconnoitre in which the heedless gentleman who gads upon the road unless he prove a fighter may find himself within that isle of riches exposd to lose his life as well as breeches  xii  juan who did not understand a word of english save their shibboleth god damn and even that he had so rarely heard he sometimes thought twas only their salam or god be with youand tis not absurd to think so for half english as i am to my misfortune never can i say i heard them wish god with you save that way  xiii  juan yet quickly understood their gesture and being somewhat choleric and sudden drew forth a pocket pistol from his vesture and fired it into one assailants pudding who fell as rolls an ox oer in his pasture and roard out as he writhd his native mud in unto his nearest follower or henchman oh jack im floord by that ere bloody frenchman  xiv  on which jack and his train set off at speed and juans suite late scatterd at a distance came up all marvelling at such a deed and offering as usual late assistance juan who saw the moons late minion bleed as if his veins would pour out his existence stood calling out for bandages and lint and wishd he had been less hasty with his flint  xv  perhapsthought heit is the countrys wont to welcome foreigners in this way now i recollect some innkeepers who dont differ except in robbing with a bow in lieu of a bare blade and brazen front but what is to be done i cant allow the fellow to lie groaning on the road so take him up ill help you with the load  xvi  but ere they could perform this pious duty the dying man cried hold ive got my gruel oh for a glass of max weve missd our booty let me die where i am and as the fuel of life shrunk in his heart and thick and sooty the drops fell from his deathwound and he drew ill his breath he from his swelling throat untied a kerchief crying give sal thatand died  xvii  the cravat staind with bloody drops fell down before don juans feet he could not tell exactly why it was before him thrown nor what the meaning of the mans farewell poor tom was once a kiddy upon town a thorough varmint and a real swell full flash all fancy until fairly diddled his pockets first and then his body riddled  xviii  don juan having done the best he could in all the circumstances of the case as soon as crowners quest allowd pursud his travels to the capital apace esteeming it a little hard he should in twelve hours time and very little space have been obligd to slay a freeborn native in selfdefence this made him meditative  xix  he from the world had cut off a great man who in his time had made heroic bustle who in a row like tom could lead the van booze in the ken or at the spellken hustle who queer a flat who spite of bowstreets ban on the high tobyspice so flash the muzzle who on a lark with blackeyed sal his blowing so prime so swell so nutty and so knowing  xx  but toms no moreand so no more of tom heroes must die and by gods blessing tis not long before

wish ourselves in town at once  xxi  through groves so called as being void of trees like lucus from no light through prospects namd mount pleasant as containing nought to please nor much to climb

approach of travellers to mighty babylon whether they come by horse or chaise or coach with slight exceptions all the ways seem one i could say more but do not choose to encroach upon the guidebooks

xxvii  a row of gentlemen along the streets suspended may illuminate mankind as also bonfires made of country seats but the old way is best for the purblind the other looks like phosphorus on sheets a sort of ignis fatuus to the mind which though tis certain to perplex and frighten must burn more mildly ere it can enlighten  xxviii  but londons so well lit that if diogenes could recommence to hunt

palace and st jamess hells  xxx  they reachd the hotel forth streamd from the front door a tide of wellclad waiters and around the mob stood and as usual several score of those pedestrian paphians who abound in decent london when the daylights oer commodious but immoral they are found useful like malthus in promoting marriage but juan now is stepping from his carriage  xxxi  into one of the sweetest of hotels especially for foreignersand mostly for those whom favour or whom fortune swells and cannot find a bills small items costly there many an envoy either dwelt or dwells the den of many a diplomatic lost lie until to some conspicuous square they pass and blazon oer the door their names in brass  xxxii  juan whose was a delicate commission private though publicly important bore no title to point out with due precision the exact affair on which he was sent oer twas merely known that on a secret mission a foreigner of rank had gracd our shore young handsome and accomplishd who was said in whispers to have turnd his sovereigns head  xxxiii  some rumour also of some strange adventures had gone before him and his wars and loves and as romantic heads are pretty painters and

russ credential and was receivd with all the due grimace by those who govern in the mood potential who seeing a handsome stripling with smooth face thought what in state affairs is most essential that they as easily might do the youngster as hawks may pounce upon a woodland songster  xxxvi  they errd as aged men will do but by and by well talk of that and if we dont t will be because our notion is not high of politicians and their double front who live by lies yet dare not boldly lie now what i love in women is they wont or cant do otherwise than lie but do it so well the very truth seems falsehood to it  xxxvii  and after all what is a lie tis but the truth in masquerade and i defy historians heroes lawyers priests to put a fact without some leaven of a lie the very shadow of true truth would shut up annals revelations poesy and prophecyexcept it should be dated some years before the incidents related  xxxviii  praisd be all liars and all lies who now can tax my mild muse with misanthropy she rings the worlds te deum and her brow blushes for those who will not but to sigh is idle let us like most others bow kiss hands feet any part of majesty after the good example of green erin whose shamrock now seems rather worse for wearing  xxxix  don juan was presented and his dress and mien excited general admiration i dont know which was more admird or less one monstrous diamond drew much observation which catherine in a moment of ivresse in love or brandys fervent fermentation bestowd upon him as the public learnd and to say truth it had been fairly earnd  xl  besides the

dear offices of peace or war and should you doubt pray ask of your next neighbour when for a passport or some other bar to freedom he applied a grief and a bore if he found not this spawn of taxborn riches like lapdogs the least civil sons of bs  xlii  but juan was receivd with much empressement  these phrases of refinement i must borrow from our next neighbours land where like a chessman there is a move set down for joy or sorrow not only in mere talking but the press man in islands is it seems downright and thorough more than on continentsas if the sea see billingsgate made even the tongue

about twice two thousand people bred by no means to be very wise or witty but to sit up while others lie in bed and look down on the universe with pity juan as an inveterate patrician was well receivd

some momemt to the latter a ribs a thorn in a wed gallants side requires decorum and is apt to double the horrid sinand whats still worse the trouble  xlvii  but juan was a bachelorof arts and parts and hearts he dancd and sung and had an air as sentimental as mozarts softest of melodies and could be sad or cheerful without any flaws or starts just at the proper time and though a lad had seen the worldwhich is a curious sight and very much unlike what people write  xlviii  fair virgins blushd upon him wedded dames bloomd also in less transitory hues for both commodities dwell by the thames the

let the babel round run as it may and look on as a mourner or a scorner or an approver or a mere spectator yawning a little as the night grows later  lxx  but this wont do save by and by and he who like don juan takes an active share must steer with care through all that glittering sea of gems and plumes and pearls and silks to where he deems it is his proper place to be dissolving in the waltz
