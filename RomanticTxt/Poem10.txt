my sister my sweet sister if a name dearer and purer were it should be thine mountains and seas divide us but i claim no tears but tenderness to answer mine go where i will to me thou art the same a lovd regret which i would not resign there yet are two things in my destiny a world to roam through and a home with thee  the first were nothinghad i still the last it were the haven of my happiness but other claims and other ties thou hast and mine is not the wish to make them less a strange doom is thy fathers sons and past recalling as it lies beyond redress reversd for him our grandsires fate of yore he had no rest at sea nor i on shore  if my inheritance of storms hath been in other elements and on the rocks of perils overlookd or unforeseen i have sustaind my share of worldly shocks the fault was mine nor do i seek to screen my errors with defensive paradox i have been cunning in mine overthrow the careful pilot of my proper woe  mine were my faults and mine be their reward my whole life was a contest since the day that gave me being gave me that which marrd the gifta fate or will that walkd astray and i at times have found the struggle hard and thought of shaking off my bonds of clay but now i fain would for a time survive if but to see what next can well arrive  kingdoms and empires in my little day i have outlivd and yet i am not old and when i look on this the petty spray of my own years of trouble which have rolld like a wild bay of breakers melts away somethingi know not whatdoes still uphold a spirit of slight patience not in vain even for its own sake do we purchase pain  perhaps the workings of defiance stir within meor perhaps a cold despair brought on when ills habitually recur perhaps a kinder clime or purer air for even to this may change of soul refer and with light armour we may learn to bear have taught me a strange quiet which was not the chief companion of a calmer lot  i feel almost at times as i have felt in happy childhood trees and flowers and brooks which do remember me of where i dwelt ere my young mind was sacrificd to books come as of yore upon me and can melt my heart with recognition of their looks and even at moments i could think i see some living thing to lovebut none like thee  here are the alpine landscapes which create a fund for contemplation to admire is a brief feeling of a trivial date but something worthier do such scenes inspire here to be lonely is not desolate for much i view which i could most desire and above all a lake i can behold lovelier not dearer than our own of old  oh that thou wert but with mebut i grow the fool of my own wishes and forget the solitude which i have vaunted so has lost its praise in this but one regret there may be others which i less may show i am not of the plaintive mood and yet i feel an ebb in my philosophy and the tide rising in my alterd eye  i did remind thee of our own dear lake by the old hall which may be mine no more lemans is fair but think not i forsake the sweet remembrance of a dearer shore sad havoc time must with my memory make ere that or thou can fade these eyes before though like all things which i have lovd they are resignd for ever or divided far  the world is all before me i but ask of nature that with which she will comply it is but in her summers sun to bask to mingle with the quiet of her sky to see her gentle face without a mask and never gaze on it with apathy she was my early friend and now shall be my sistertill i look again on thee  i can reduce all feelings but this one and that i would not for at length i see such scenes as those wherein my life begun the earliesteven the only paths for me had i but sooner learnt the crowd to shun i had been better than i now can be the passions which have torn me would have slept i had not sufferd and thou hadst not wept  with false ambition what had i to do little with love and least of all with fame and yet they came unsought and with me grew and made me all which they can makea name yet this was not the end i did pursue surely i once beheld a nobler aim but all is overi am one the more to baffled millions which have gone before  and for the future this worlds future may from me demand but little of my care i have outlivd myself by many a day having survivd so many things that were my years have been no slumber but the prey of ceaseless vigils for i had the share of life which might have filld a century before its fourth in time had passd me by  and for the remnant which may be to come i am content and for the past i feel not thankless for within the crowded sum of struggles happiness at times would steal and for the present i would not benumb my feelings further nor shall i conceal that with all this i still can look around and worship nature with a thought profound  for thee my own sweet sister in thy heart i know myself secure as thou in mine we were and arei am even as thou art beings who neer each other can resign it is the same together or apart from lifes commencement to its slow decline we are entwindlet death come slow or fast the tie which bound the first endures the last
