like a lone arab old and blind some caravan had left behind who sits beside a ruind well where the shy sandasps bask and swell and now he hangs his aged head aslant and listens for a human soundin vain and now the aid which heaven alone can grant upturns his eyeless face from heaven to gain even thus in vacant mood one sultry hour resting my eye upon a drooping plant with brow lowbent within my gardenbower i sate upon the couch of camomile andwhether twas a transient sleep perchance flitted across the idle brain the while i watchd the sickly calm with aimless scope in my own heart or that indeed a trance turnd my eye inwardthee o genial hope loves elder sister thee did i behold drest as a bridesmaid but all pale and cold with roseless cheek all pale and cold and dim lie lifeless at my feet and then came love a sylph in bridal trim and stood beside my seat she bent and kissd her sisters lips as she was wont to do alas twas but a chilling breath woke just enough of life in death to make hope die anew
