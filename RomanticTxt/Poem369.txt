i remember i remember the house where i was born the little window where the sun came peeping in at morn he never came a wink too soon nor brought too long a day but now i often wish the night had borne my breath away  i remember i remember the roses red and white the vilets and the lilycups those flowers made of light the lilacs where the robin built and where my brother set the laburnum on his birthday the tree is living yet  i remember i remember where i was used to swing and thought the air must rush as fresh to swallows on the wing my spirit flew in feathers then that is so heavy now and summer pools could hardly cool the fever on my brow  i remember i remember the fir trees dark and high i used to think their slender tops were close against the sky it was a childish ignorance but now tis little joy to know im farther off from heavn than when i was a boy
