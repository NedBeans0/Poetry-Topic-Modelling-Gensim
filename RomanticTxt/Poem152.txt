o blithe newcomer i have heard i hear thee and rejoice o cuckoo shall i call thee bird or but a wandering voice  while i am lying on the grass thy twofold shout i hear from hill to hill it seems to pass at once far off and near  though babbling only to the vale of sunshine and of flowers thou bringest unto me a tale of visionary hours  thrice welcome darling of the spring even yet thou art to me no bird but an invisible thing a voice a mystery  the same whom in my schoolboy days i listened to that cry which made me look a thousand ways in bush and tree and sky  to seek thee did i often rove through woods and on the green and thou wert still a hope a love still longed for never seen  and i can listen to thee yet can lie upon the plain and listen till i do beget that golden time again  o bless√®d bird the earth we pace again appears to be an unsubstantial faery place that is fit home for thee
