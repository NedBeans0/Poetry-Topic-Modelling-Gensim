cold blew the freezing northern blast and winter sternly frowned the flaky snow fell thick and fast and clad the fields around  forced by the storms relentless power emboldened by despair a shivering redbreast sought my door some friendly warmth to share  welcome sweet bird i fondly cried no danger needst thou fear secure with me thou mayst abide till warmer suns appear  and when mild spring comes smiling on and bids the fields look gay thou with thy sweet thy grateful song my kindness shalt repay  mistaken thought  but how shall i the mournful truth display an envious cat with jealous eye had marked him as her prey  remorseless wretch  her cruel jaws soon sealed her victims doom while i in silence mourn his loss and weep oer robins tomb  so oft in lifes uneven way some stroke may intervene sweep all our fancied joys away and change the flattering scene
