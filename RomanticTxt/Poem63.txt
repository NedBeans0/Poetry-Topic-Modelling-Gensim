emily a ship is floating in the harbour now a wind is hovering oer the mountains brow there is a path on the seas azure floor no keel has ever ploughd that path before the halcyons brood around the foamless isles the treacherous ocean has forsworn its wiles the merry mariners are bold and free say my hearts sister wilt thou sail with me our bark is as an albatross whose nest is a far eden of the purple east and we between her wings will sit while night and day and storm and calm pursue their flight our ministers along the boundless sea treading each others heels unheededly it is an isle under ionian skies beautiful as a wreck of paradise and for the harbours are not safe and good this land would have remaind a solitude but for some pastoral people native there who from the elysian clear and golden air draw the last spirit of the age of gold simple and spirited innocent and bold the blue aegean girds this chosen home with everchanging sound and light and foam kissing the sifted sands and caverns hoar and all the winds wandering along the shore undulate with the undulating tide there are thick woods where sylvan forms abide and many a fountain rivulet and pond as clear as elemental diamond or serene morning air and far beyond the mossy tracks made by the goats and deer which the rough shepherd treads but once a year pierce into glades caverns and bowers and halls built round with ivy which the waterfalls illumining with sound that never fails accompany the noonday nightingales and all the place is peopled with sweet airs the light clear element which the isle wears is heavy with the scent of lemonflowers which floats like mist laden with unseen showers and falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep and from the moss violets and jonquils peep and dart their arrowy odour through the brain till you might faint with that delicious pain and every motion odour beam and tone with that deep music is in unison which is a soul within the soulthey seem like echoes of an antenatal dream it is an isle twixt heaven air earth and sea cradled and hung in clear tranquillity bright as that wandering eden lucifer washd by the soft blue oceans of young air it is a favourd place famine or blight pestilence war and earthquake never light upon its mountainpeaks blind vultures they sail onward far upon their fatal way the wing√®d storms chanting their thunderpsalm to other lands leave azure chasms of calm over this isle or weep themselves in dew from which its fields and woods ever renew their green and golden immortality and from the sea there rise and from the sky there fall clear exhalations soft and bright veil after veil each hiding some delight which sun or moon or zephyr draw aside till the isles beauty like a naked bride glowing at once with love and loveliness blushes and trembles at its own excess yet like a buried lamp a soul no less burns in the heart of this delicious isle an atom of th eternal whose own smile unfolds itself and may be felt not seen oer the gray rocks blue waves and forests green filling their bare and void interstices but the chief marvel of the wilderness is a lone dwelling built by whom or how none of the rustic islandpeople know tis not a tower of strength though with its height it overtops the woods but for delight some wise and tender oceanking ere crime had been invented in the worlds young prime reard it a wonder of that simple time an envy of the isles a pleasurehouse made sacred to his sister and his spouse it scarce seems now a wreck of human art but as it were titanic in the heart of earth having assumd its form then grown out of the mountains from the living stone lifting itself in caverns light and high for all the antique and learned imagery has been erasd and in the place of it the ivy and the wildvine interknit the volumes of their manytwining stems parasite flowers illume with dewy gems the lampless halls and when they fade the sky peeps through their winterwoof of tracery with moonlight patches or star atoms keen or fragments of the days intense serene working mosaic on their parian floors and day and night aloof from the high towers and terraces the earth and ocean seem to sleep in one anothers arms and dream of waves flowers clouds woods rocks and all that we read in their smiles and call reality  this isle and house are mine and i have vowd thee to be lady of the solitude and i have fitted up some chambers there looking towards the golden eastern air and level with the living winds which flow like waves above the living waves below i have sent books and music there and all those instruments with which high spirits call the future from its cradle and the past out of its grave and make the present last in thoughts and joys which sleep but cannot die folded within their own eternity our simple life wants little and true taste hires not the pale drudge luxury to waste the scene it would adorn and therefore still nature with all her children haunts the hill the ringdove in the embowering ivy yet keeps up her lovelament and the owls flit round the evening tower and the young stars glance between the quick bats in their twilight dance the spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight before our gate and the slow silent night is measurd by the pants of their calm sleep be this our home in life and when years heap their witherd hours like leaves on our decay let us become the overhanging day the living soul of this elysian isle conscious inseparable one meanwhile we two will rise and sit and walk together under the roof of blue ionian weather and wander in the meadows or ascend the mossy mountains where the blue heavens bend with lightest winds to touch their paramour or linger where the pebblepaven shore under the quick faint kisses of the sea trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy possessing and possessd by all that is within that calm circumference of bliss and by each other till to love and live be one or at the noontide hour arrive where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep the moonlight of the expird night asleep through which the awakend day can never peep a veil for our seclusion close as nights where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights sleep the fresh dew of languid love the rain whose drops quench kisses till they burn again and we will talk until thoughts melody become too sweet for utterance and it die in words to live again in looks which dart with thrilling tone into the voiceless heart harmonizing silence without a sound our breath shall intermix our bosoms bound and our veins beat together and our lips with other eloquence than words eclipse the soul that burns between them and the wells which boil under our beings inmost cells the fountains of our deepest life shall be confusd in passions golden purity as mountainsprings under the morning sun we shall become the same we shall be one spirit within two frames oh wherefore two one passion in twinhearts which grows and grew till like two meteors of expanding flame those spheres instinct with it become the same touch mingle are transfigurd ever still burning yet ever inconsumable in one anothers substance finding food like flames too pure and light and unimbud to nourish their bright lives with baser prey which point to heaven and cannot pass away one hope within two wills one will beneath two overshadowing minds one life one death one heaven one hell one immortality and one annihilation woe is me the winged words on which my soul would pierce into the height of loves rare universe are chains of lead around its flight of fire i pant i sink i tremble i expire
