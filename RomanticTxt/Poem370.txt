she stood breast high amid the corn clasped by the golden light of morn like the sweetheart of the sun who many a glowing kiss had won  on her cheek an autumn flush deeply ripenedsuch a blush in the midst of brown was born like red poppies grown with corn  round her eyes her tresses fell which were blackest none could tell but long lashes veiled a light that had else been all too bright  and her hat with shady brim made her tressy forehead dim thus she stood amid the stooks praising god with sweetest looks  sure i said heaven did not mean where i reap thou shouldst but glean lay thy sheaf adown and come share my harvest and my home
