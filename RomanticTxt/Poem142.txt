behold her single in the field yon solitary highland lass reaping and singing by herself stop here or gently pass alone she cuts and binds the grain and sings a melancholy strain o listen for the vale profound is overflowing with the sound  no nightingale did ever chaunt more welcome notes to weary bands of travellers in some shady haunt among arabian sands a voice so thrilling neer was heard in springtime from the cuckoobird breaking the silence of the seas among the farthest hebrides  will no one tell me what she sings perhaps the plaintive numbers flow for old unhappy faroff things and battles long ago or is it some more humble lay familiar matter of today some natural sorrow loss or pain that has been and may be again  whateer the theme the maiden sang as if her song could have no ending i saw her singing at her work and oer the sickle bending i listened motionless and still and as i mounted up the hill the music in my heart i bore long after it was heard no more
