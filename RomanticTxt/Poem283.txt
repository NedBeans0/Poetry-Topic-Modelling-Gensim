written at norfolk in virginia they made her a grave too cold and damp for a soul so warm and true and shes gone to the lake of the dismal swamp where all night long by a firefly lamp she paddles her white canoe  and her firefly lamp i soon shall see and her paddle i soon shall hear long and loving our life shall be and ill hide the maid in a cypress tree when the footstep of death is near  away to the dismal swamp he speeds his path was rugged and sore through tangled juniper beds of reeds through many a fen where the serpent feeds and man never trod before  and when on the earth he sunk to sleep if slumber his eyelids knew he lay where the deadly vine doth weep its venomous tear and nightly steep the flesh with blistering dew  and near him the shewolf stirrd the brake and the coppersnake breathd in his ear till he starting cried from his dream awake oh when shall i see the dusky lake and the white canoe of my dear  he saw the lake and a meteor bright quick over its surface playd welcome he said my dear ones light and the dim shore echoed for many a night the name of the deathcold maid  till he hollowd a boat of the birchen bark which carried him off from shore far far he followd the meteor spark the wind was high and the clouds were dark and the boat returnd no more  but oft from the indian hunters camp this lover and maid so true are seen at the hour of midnight damp to cross the lake by a firefly lamp and paddle their white canoe
