just by the wooden brig a bird flew up frit by the cowboy as he scrambled down to reach the misty dewberrylet us stoop and seek its nestthe brook we need not dread tis scarcely deep enough a bee to drown so it sings harmless oer its pebbly bed ay here it is stuck close beside the bank beneath the bunch of grass that spindles rank its husk seeds tall and hightis rudely planned of bleach√®d stubbles and the withered fare that last years harvest left upon the land lined thinly with the horses sable hair five eggs penscribbled oer with ink their shells resembling writing scrawls which fancy reads as natures poesy and pastoral spells they are the yellowhammers and she dwells most poetlike where brooks and flowery weeds as sweet as castaly to fancy seems and that old molehill like as parnass hill on which her partner haply sits and dreams oer all her joys of songso leave it still a happy home of sunshine flowers and streams yet in the sweetest places cometh ill a noisome weed that burthens every soil for snakes are known with chill and deadly coil to watch such nests and seize the helpless young and like as though the plague became a guest leaving a houseless home a ruined nest and mournful hath the little warblers sung when such like woes hath rent its little breast
