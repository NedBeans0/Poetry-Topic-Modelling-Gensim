the frost performs its secret ministry unhelped by any wind the owlets cry came loudand hark again loud as before the inmates of my cottage all at rest have left me to that solitude which suits abstruser musings save that at my side my cradled infant slumbers peacefully tis calm indeed so calm that it disturbs and vexes meditation with its strange and extreme silentness sea hill and wood this populous village sea and hill and wood with all the numberless goingson of life inaudible as dreams the thin blue flame lies on my lowburnt fire and quivers not only that film which fluttered on the grate  still flutters there the sole unquiet thing methinks its motion in this hush of nature gives it dim sympathies with me who live making it a companionable form whose puny flaps and freaks the idling spirit by its own moods interprets every where echo or mirror seeking of itself and makes a toy of thought  but o how oft how oft at school with most believing mind presageful have i gazed upon the bars to watch that fluttering stranger and as oft with unclosed lids already had i dreamt of my sweet birthplace and the old churchtower whose bells the poor mans only music rang from morn to evening all the hot fairday so sweetly that they stirred and haunted me with a wild pleasure falling on mine ear most like articulate sounds of things to come so gazed i till the soothing things i dreamt lulled me to sleep and sleep prolonged my dreams and so i brooded all the following morn awed by the stern preceptors face mine eye fixed with mock study on my swimming book save if the door half opened and i snatched a hasty glance and still my heart leaped up for still i hoped to see the strangers face townsman or aunt or sister more beloved my playmate when we both were clothed alike  dear babe that sleepest cradled by my side whose gentle breathings heard in this deep calm fill up the interspers√©d vacancies and momentary pauses of the thought my babe so beautiful it thrills my heart with tender gladness thus to look at thee and think that thou shalt learn far other lore and in far other scenes for i was reared in the great city pent mid cloisters dim and saw nought lovely but the sky and stars but thou my babe shalt wander like a breeze by lakes and sandy shores beneath the crags of ancient mountain and beneath the clouds which image in their bulk both lakes and shores and mountain crags so shalt thou see and hear the lovely shapes and sounds intelligible of that eternal language which thy god utters who from eternity doth teach himself in all and all things in himself great universal teacher he shall mould thy spirit and by giving make it ask  therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee whether the summer clothe the general earth with greenness or the redbreast sit and sing betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch of mossy appletree while the nightthatch smokes in the sunthaw whether the eavedrops fall heard only in the trances of the blast or if the secret ministry of frost shall hang them up in silent icicles quietly shining to the quiet moon
