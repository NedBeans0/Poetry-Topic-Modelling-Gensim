difficile est proprie communia dicere  hor epist ad pison i  bob southey youre a poetpoetlaureate and representative of all the race although tis true that you turnd out a tory at lastyours has lately been a common case and now my epic renegade what are ye at with all the lakers in and out of place a nest of tuneful persons to my eye like four and twenty blackbirds in a pye  ii  which pye being opend they began to sing this old song and new simile holds good a dainty dish to set before the king or regent who admires such kind of food and coleridge too has lately taken wing but like a hawk encumberd with his hood explaining metaphysics to the nation i wish he would explain his explanation  iii  you bob are rather insolent you know at being disappointed in your wish to supersede all warblers here below and be the only blackbird in the dish and then you overstrain yourself or so and tumble downward like the flying fish gasping on deck because you soar too high bob and fall for lack of moisture quite adry bob  iv  and wordsworth in a rather long excursion i think the quarto holds five hundred pages has given a sample from the vasty version of his new system to perplex the sages tis poetryat least by his assertion and may appear so when the dogstar rages and he who understands it would be able to add a story to the tower of babel  v  yougentlemen by dint of long seclusion from better company have kept your own at keswick and through still continud fusion of one anothers minds at last have grown to deem as a most logical conclusion that poesy has wreaths for you alone there is a narrowness in such a notion which makes me wish youd change your lakes for ocean  vi  i would not imitate the petty thought nor coin my selflove to so base a vice for all the glory your conversion brought since gold alone should not have been its price you have your salary wast for that you wrought and wordsworth has his place in the excise youre shabby fellowstruebut poets still and duly seated on the immortal hill  vii  your bays may hide the baldness of your brows perhaps some virtuous blusheslet them go to you i envy neither fruit nor boughs and for the fame you would engross below the field is universal and allows scope to all such as feel the inherent glow scott rogers campbell moore and crabbe will try gainst you the question with posterity  viii  for me who wandering with pedestrian muses contend not with you on the winged steed i wish your fate may yield ye when she chooses the fame you envy and the skill you need and recollect a poet nothing loses in giving to his brethren their full meed of merit and complaint of present days is not the certain path to future praise  ix  he that reserves his laurels for posterity who does not often claim the bright reversion has generally no great crop to spare it he being only injurd by his own assertion and although here and there some glorious rarity arise like titan from the seas immersion the major part of such appellants go togod knows wherefor no one else can know  x  if fallen in evil days on evil tongues milton appeald to the avenger time if time the avenger execrates his wrongs and makes the word miltonic mean sublime he deignd not to belie his soul in songs nor turn his very talent to a crime he did not loathe the sire to laud the son but closd the tyranthater he begun  xi  thinkst thou could hethe blind old manarise like samuel from the grave to freeze once more the blood of monarchs with his prophecies or be alive againagain all hoar with time and trials and those helpless eyes and heartless daughterswornand paleand poor would he adore a sultanhe obey the intellectual eunuch castlereagh  xii  coldblooded smoothfacd placid miscreant dabbling its sleek young hands in erins gore and thus for wider carnage taught to pant transferrd to gorge upon a sister shore the vulgarest tool that tyranny could want with just enough of talent and no more to lengthen fetters by another fixd and offer poison long already mixd  xiii  an orator of such set trash of phrase ineffablylegitimately vile that even its grossest flatterers dare not praise nor foesall nationscondescend to smile not even a sprightly blunders spark can blaze from that ixion grindstones ceaseless toil that turns and turns to give the world a notion of endless torments and perpetual motion  xiv  a bungler even in its disgusting trade and botching patching leaving still behind something of which its masters are afraid states to be curbd and thoughts to be confind conspiracy or congress to be made cobbling at manacles for all mankind a tinkering slavemaker who mends old chains with god and mans abhorrence for its gains  xv  if we may judge of matter by the mind emasculated to the marrow it hath but two objects how to serve and bind deeming the chain it wears even men may fit eutropius of its many masters blind to worth as freedom wisdom as to wit fearlessbecause no feeling dwells in ice its very courage stagnates to a vice  xvi  where shall i turn me not to view its bonds for i will never feel themitaly thy late reviving roman soul desponds beneath the lie this statething breathd oer thee thy clanking chain and erins yet green wounds have voicestongues to cry aloud for me europe has slavesallieskingsarmies still and southey lives to sing them very ill  xvii  meantimesir laureatei proceed to dedicate in honest simple verse this song to you and if in flattering strains i do not predicate tis that i still retain my buff and blue my politics as yet are all to educate apostasys so fashionable too to keep one creeds a task grown quite herculean is it not so my tory ultrajulian
