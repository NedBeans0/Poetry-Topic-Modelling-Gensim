beneath these fruittree boughs that shed their snowwhite blossoms on my head with brightest sunshine round me spread of springs unclouded weather in this sequestered nook how sweet to sit upon my orchardseat and birds and flowers once more to greet my last years friends together  one have i marked the happiest guest in all this covert of the blest hail to thee far above the rest in joy of voice and pinion thou linnet in thy green array presiding spirit here today dost lead the revels of the may and this is thy dominion  while birds and butterflies and flowers make all one band of paramours thou ranging up and down the bowers art sole in thy employment a life a presence like the air scattering thy gladness without care too blest with any one to pair thyself thy own enjoyment  amid yon tuft of hazel trees that twinkle to the gusty breeze behold him perched in ecstasies yet seeming still to hover there where the flutter of his wings upon his back and body flings shadows and sunny glimmerings that cover him all over  my dazzled sight he oft deceives a brother of the dancing leaves then flits and from the cottageeaves pours forth his song in gushes as if by that exulting strain he mocked and treated with disdain the voiceless form he chose to feign while fluttering in the bushes
