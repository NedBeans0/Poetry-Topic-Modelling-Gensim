this sycamore oft musical with bees such tents the patriarchs loved o long unharmed may all its ag√®d boughs oercanopy the small round basin which this jutting stone keeps pure from falling leaves long may the spring quietly as a sleeping infants breath send up cold waters to the traveller with soft and even pulse nor ever cease yon tiny cone of sand its soundless dance which at the bottom like a fairys page as merry and no taller dances still nor wrinkles the smooth surface of the fount here twilight is and coolness here is moss a soft seat and a deep and ample shade thou mayst toil far and find no second tree drink pilgrim here here rest and if thy heart be innocent here too shalt thou refresh thy spirit listening to some gentle sound or passing gale or hum of murmuring bees
