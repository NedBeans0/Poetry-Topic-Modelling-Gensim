on this day i complete my thirtysixth year tis time this heart should be unmoved since others it hath ceased to move yet though i cannot be beloved still let me love  my days are in the yellow leaf the flowers and fruits of love are gone the wormthe canker and the grief are mine alone  the fire that on my bosom preys is lone as some volcanic isle no torch is kindled at its blaze a funeral pile  the hope the fear the jealous care the exalted portion of the pain and power of love i cannot share but wear the chain  but tis not thusand tis not here such thoughts should shake my soul nor now where glory decks the heros bier or binds his brow  the sword the banner and the field glory and greece around us see the spartan borne upon his shield was not more free  awake not greeceshe is awake awake my spirit think through whom thy lifeblood tracks its parent lake and then strike home  tread those reviving passions down unworthy manhoodunto thee indifferent should the smile or frown of beauty be  if thou regretst thy youthwhy live the land of honourable death is hereup to the field and give away thy breath  seek outless often sought than found a soldiers grave for thee the best then look around and choose thy ground and take thy rest
