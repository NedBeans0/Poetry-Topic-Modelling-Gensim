when midst the gay i meet that gentle smile of thine though still on me it turns most sweet i scarce can call it mine but when to me alone your secret tears you show oh then i feel those tears my own and claim them while they flow then still with bright looks bless the gay the cold the free give smiles to those who love you less but keep your tears for me  the snow on juras steep can smile in many a beam yet still in chains of coldness sleep how bright soeer it seem but when some deepfelt ray whose touch is fire appears oh then the smile is warmd away and melting turns to tears then still with bright looks bless the gay the cold the free give smiles to those who love you less but keep your tears for me
