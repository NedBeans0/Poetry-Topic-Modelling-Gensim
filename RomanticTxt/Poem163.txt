late late yestreen i saw the new moon with the old moon in her arms and i fear i fear my master dear we shall have a deadly storm ballad of sir patrick spence  i  well if the bard was weatherwise who made the grand old ballad of sir patrick spence this night so tranquil now will not go hence unroused by winds that ply a busier trade than those which mould yon cloud in lazy flakes or the dull sobbing draft that moans and rakes upon the strings of this Ã¦olian lute which better far were mute for lo the newmoon winterbright and overspread with phantom light with swimming phantom light oerspread but rimmed and circled by a silver thread i see the old moon in her lap foretelling the comingon of rain and squally blast and oh that even now the gust were swelling and the slant nightshower driving loud and fast those sounds which oft have raised me whilst they awed and sent my soul abroad might now perhaps their wonted impulse give might startle this dull pain and make it move and live  ii  a grief without a pang void dark and drear a stifled drowsy unimpassioned grief which finds no natural outlet no relief in word or sigh or tear o lady in this wan and heartless mood to other thoughts by yonder throstle wood all this long eve so balmy and serene have i been gazing on the western sky and its peculiar tint of yellow green and still i gazeand with how blank an eye and those thin clouds above in flakes and bars that give away their motion to the stars those stars that glide behind them or between now sparkling now bedimmed but always seen yon crescent moon as fixed as if it grew in its own cloudless starless lake of blue i see them all so excellently fair i see not feel how beautiful they are  iii  my genial spirits fail and what can these avail to lift the smothering weight from off my breast it were a vain endeavour though i should gaze for ever on that green light that lingers in the west i may not hope from outward forms to win the passion and the life whose fountains are within  iv  o lady we receive but what we give and in our life alone does nature live ours is her wedding garment ours her shroud and would we aught behold of higher worth than that inanimate cold world allowed to the poor loveless everanxious crowd ah from the soul itself must issue forth a light a glory a fair luminous cloud enveloping the earth and from the soul itself must there be sent a sweet and potent voice of its own birth of all sweet sounds the life and element  v  o pure of heart thou needst not ask of me what this strong music in the soul may be what and wherein it doth exist this light this glory this fair luminous mist this beautiful and beautymaking power joy virtuous lady joy that neer was given save to the pure and in their purest hour life and lifes effluence cloud at once and shower joy lady is the spirit and the power which wedding nature to us gives in dower a new earth and new heaven undreamt of by the sensual and the proud joy is the sweet voice joy the luminous cloud we in ourselves rejoice and thence flows all that charms or ear or sight all melodies the echoes of that voice all colours a suffusion from that light  vi  there was a time when though my path was rough this joy within me dallied with distress and all misfortunes were but as the stuff whence fancy made me dreams of happiness for hope grew round me like the twining vine and fruits and foliage not my own seemed mine but now afflictions bow me down to earth nor care i that they rob me of my mirth but oh each visitation suspends what nature gave me at my birth my shaping spirit of imagination for not to think of what i needs must feel but to be still and patient all i can and haply by abstruse research to steal from my own nature all the natural man this was my sole resource my only plan till that which suits a part infects the whole and now is almost grown the habit of my soul  vii  hence viper thoughts that coil around my mind realitys dark dream i turn from you and listen to the wind which long has raved unnoticed what a scream of agony by torture lengthened out that lute sent forth thou wind that ravst without bare crag or mountaintairn or blasted tree or pinegrove whither woodman never clomb or lonely house long held the witches home methinks were fitter instruments for thee mad lutanist who in this month of showers of darkbrown gardens and of peeping flowers makst devils yule with worse than wintry song the blossoms buds and timorous leaves among thou actor perfect in all tragic sounds thou mighty poet een to frenzy bold what tellst thou now about tis of the rushing of an host in rout with groans of trampled men with smarting wounds at once they groan with pain and shudder with the cold but hush there is a pause of deepest silence and all that noise as of a rushing crowd with groans and tremulous shudderingsall is over it tells another tale with sounds less deep and loud a tale of less affright and tempered with delight as otways self had framed the tender lay tis of a little child upon a lonesome wild nor far from home but she hath lost her way and now moans low in bitter grief and fear and now screams loud and hopes to make her mother hear  viii  tis midnight but small thoughts have i of sleep full seldom may my friend such vigils keep visit her gentle sleep with wings of healing and may this storm be but a mountainbirth may all the stars hang bright above her dwelling silent as though they watched the sleeping earth with light heart may she rise gay fancy cheerful eyes joy lift her spirit joy attune her voice to her may all things live from pole to pole their life the eddying of her living soul o simple spirit guided from above dear lady friend devoutest of my choice thus mayest thou ever evermore rejoice
