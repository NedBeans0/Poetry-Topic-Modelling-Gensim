i  o wild west wind thou breath of autumns being thou from whose unseen presence the leaves dead are driven like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing  yellow and black and pale and hectic red pestilencestricken multitudes o thou who chariotest to their dark wintry bed  the winged seeds where they lie cold and low each like a corpse within its grave until thine azure sister of the spring shall blow  her clarion oer the dreaming earth and fill driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air with living hues and odours plain and hill  wild spirit which art moving everywhere destroyer and preserver hear oh hear  ii  thou on whose stream mid the steep skys commotion loose clouds like earths decaying leaves are shed shook from the tangled boughs of heaven and ocean  angels of rain and lightning there are spread on the blue surface of thine aÃ«ry surge like the bright hair uplifted from the head  of some fierce maenad even from the dim verge of the horizon to the zeniths height the locks of the approaching storm thou dirge  of the dying year to which this closing night will be the dome of a vast sepulchre vaulted with all thy congregated might  of vapours from whose solid atmosphere black rain and fire and hail will burst oh hear  iii  thou who didst waken from his summer dreams the blue mediterranean where he lay lulld by the coil of his crystalline streams  beside a pumice isle in baiaes bay and saw in sleep old palaces and towers quivering within the waves intenser day  all overgrown with azure moss and flowers so sweet the sense faints picturing them thou for whose path the atlantics level powers  cleave themselves into chasms while far below the seablooms and the oozy woods which wear the sapless foliage of the ocean know  thy voice and suddenly grow gray with fear and tremble and despoil themselves oh hear  iv  if i were a dead leaf thou mightest bear if i were a swift cloud to fly with thee a wave to pant beneath thy power and share  the impulse of thy strength only less free than thou o uncontrollable if even i were as in my boyhood and could be  the comrade of thy wanderings over heaven as then when to outstrip thy skiey speed scarce seemd a vision i would neer have striven  as thus with thee in prayer in my sore need oh lift me as a wave a leaf a cloud i fall upon the thorns of life i bleed  a heavy weight of hours has chaind and bowd one too like thee tameless and swift and proud  v  make me thy lyre even as the forest is what if my leaves are falling like its own the tumult of thy mighty harmonies  will take from both a deep autumnal tone sweet though in sadness be thou spirit fierce my spirit be thou me impetuous one  drive my dead thoughts over the universe like witherd leaves to quicken a new birth and by the incantation of this verse  scatter as from an unextinguishd hearth ashes and sparks my words among mankind be through my lips to unawakend earth  the trumpet of a prophecy o wind if winter comes can spring be far behind
