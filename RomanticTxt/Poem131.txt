was it for this that one the fairest of all rivers lovd to blend his murmurs with my nurses song and from his alder shades and rocky falls and from his fords and shallows sent a voice that flowd along my dreams for this didst thou o derwent travelling over the green plains near my sweet birthplace didst thou beauteous stream make ceaseless music through the night and day which with its steady cadence tempering our human waywardness composd my thoughts to more than infant softness giving me among the fretful dwellings of mankind a knowledge a dim earnest of the calm that nature breathes among the hills and groves when having left his mountains to the towers of cockermouth that beauteous river came behind my fathers house he passd close by along the margin of our terrace walk he was a playmate whom we dearly lovd oh many a time have i a five years child a naked boy in one delightful rill a little millrace severd from his stream made one long bathing of a summers day baskd in the sun and plunged and baskd again alternate all a summers day or coursd over the sandy fields leaping through groves of yellow grunsel or when crag and hill the woods and distant skiddaws lofty height were bronzd with a deep radiance stood alone beneath the sky as if i had been born on indian plains and from my mothers hut had run abroad in wantonness to sport a naked savage in the thunder shower  fair seedtime had my soul and i grew up fosterd alike by beauty and by fear much favourd in my birthplace and no less in that beloved vale to which erelong i was transplanted well i call to mind twas at an early age ere i had seen nine summers when upon the mountain slope the frost and breath of frosty wind had snappd the last autumnal crocus twas my joy to wander half the night among the cliffs and the smooth hollows where the woodcocks ran along the open turf in thought and wish that time my shoulder all with springes hung i was a fell destroyer on the heights scudding away from snare to snare i plied my anxious visitation hurrying on still hurrying hurrying onward moon and stars were shining oer my head i was alone and seemd to be a trouble to the peace that was among them sometimes it befel in these nightwanderings that a strong desire oerpowerd my better reason and the bird which was the captive of anothers toils became my prey and when the deed was done i heard among the solitary hills low breathings coming after me and sounds of undistinguishable motion steps almost as silent as the turf they trod nor less in springtime when on southern banks the shining sun had from his knot of leaves decoyd the primrose flower and when the vales and woods were warm was i a plunderer then in the high places on the lonesome peaks whereer among the mountains and the winds the mother bird had built her lodge though mean my object and inglorious yet the end was not ignoble oh when i have hung above the ravens nest by knots of grass and halfinch fissures in the slippery rock but ill sustaind and almost as it seemd suspended by the blast which blew amain shouldering the naked crag oh at that time while on the perilous ridge i hung alone with what strange utterance did the loud dry wind blow through my ears the sky seemd not a sky of earth and with what motion movd the clouds  the mind of man is framd even like the breath and harmony of music there is a dark invisible workmanship that reconciles discordant elements and makes them move in one society ah me that all the terrors all the early miseries regrets vexations lassitudes that all the thoughts and feelings which have been infusd into my mind should ever have made up the calm existence that is mine when i am worthy of myself praise to the end thanks likewise for the means but i believe that nature oftentimes when she would frame a favord being from his earliest dawn of infancy doth open out the clouds as at the touch of lightning seeking him with gentlest visitation not the less though haply aiming at the selfsame end does it delight her sometimes to employ severer interventions ministry more palpable and so she dealt with me  one evening surely i was led by her i went alone into a shepherds boat a skiff that to a willow tree was tied within a rocky cave its usual home twas by the shores of patterdale a vale wherein i was a stranger thither come a schoolboy traveller at the holidays forth rambled from the village inn alone no sooner had i sight of this small skiff discoverd thus by unexpected chance than i unloosd her tether and embarkd the moon was up the lake was shining clear among the hoary mountains from the shore i pushd and struck the oars and struck again in cadence and my little boat movd on even like a man who walks with stately step though bent on speed it was an act of stealth and troubled pleasure not without the voice of mountainechoes did my boat move on leaving behind her still on either side small circles glittering idly in the moon until they melted all into one track of sparkling light a rocky steep uprose above the cavern of the willow tree and now as suited one who proudly rowd with his best skill i fixd a steady view upon the top of that same craggy ridge the bound of the horizon for behind was nothing but the stars and the grey sky she was an elfin pinnace lustily i dippd my oars into the silent lake and as i rose upon the stroke my boat went heaving through the water like a swan when from behind that craggy steep till then the bound of the horizon a huge cliff as if with voluntary power instinct upreard its head i struck and struck again and growing still in stature the huge cliff rose up between me and the stars and still with measurd motion like a living thing strode after me with trembling hands i turnd and through the silent water stole my way back to the cavern of the willow tree there in her mooringplace i left my bark and through the meadows homeward went with grave and serious thoughts and after i had seen that spectacle for many days my brain workd with a dim and undetermind sense of unknown modes of being in my thoughts there was a darkness call it solitude or blank desertion no familiar shapes of hourly objects images of trees of sea or sky no colours of green fields but huge and mighty forms that do not live like living men movd slowly through the mind by day and were the trouble of my dreams  wisdom and spirit of the universe thou soul that art the eternity of thought that givst to forms and images a breath and everlasting motion not in vain by day or starlight thus from my first dawn of childhood didst thou intertwine for me the passions that build up our human soul not with the mean and vulgar works of man but with high objects with enduring things with life and nature purifying thus the elements of feeling and of thought and sanctifying by such discipline both pain and fear until we recognize a grandeur in the beatings of the heart  nor was this fellowship vouchsafd to me with stinted kindness in november days when vapours rolling down the valleys made a lonely scene more lonesome among woods at noon and mid the calm of summer nights when by the margin of the trembling lake beneath the gloomy hills i homeward went in solitude such intercourse was mine twas mine among the fields both day and night and by the waters all the summer long  and in the frosty season when the sun was set and visible for many a mile the cottage windows through the twilight blazd i heeded not the summonshappy time it was indeed for all of us to me it was a time of rapture clear and loud the village clock tolld six i wheeld about proud and exulting like an untired horse that cares not for its homeall shod with steel we hissd along the polishd ice in games confederate imitative of the chace and woodland pleasures the resounding horn the pack loud bellowing and the hunted hare so through the darkness and the cold we flew and not a voice was idle with the din meanwhile the precipices rang aloud the leafless trees and every icy crag tinkled like iron while the distant hills into the tumult sent an alien sound of melancholy not unnoticed while the stars eastward were sparkling clear and in the west the orange sky of evening died away  not seldom from the uproar i retired into a silent bay or sportively glanced sideway leaving the tumultuous throng to cut across the image of a star that gleamd upon the ice and oftentimes when we had given our bodies to the wind and all the shadowy banks on either side came sweeping through the darkness spinning still the rapid line of motion then at once have i reclining back upon my heels stoppd short yet still the solitary cliffs wheeled by me even as if the earth had rolld with visible motion her diurnal round behind me did they stretch in solemn train feebler and feebler and i stood and watchd till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep  ye presences of nature in the sky and on the earth ye visions of the hills and souls of lonely places can i think a vulgar hope was yours when ye employd such ministry when ye through many a year haunting me thus among my boyish sports on caves and trees upon the woods and hills impressd upon all forms the characters of danger or desire and thus did make the surface of the universal earth with triumph and delight and hope and fear work like a sea  not uselessly employd i might pursue this theme through every change of exercise and play to which the year did summon us in its delightful round  we were a noisy crew the sun in heaven beheld not vales more beautiful than ours nor saw a race in happiness and joy more worthy of the ground where they were sown i would record with no reluctant voice the woods of autumn and their hazel bowers with milkwhite clusters hung the rod and line true symbol of the foolishness of hope which with its strong enchantment led us on by rocks and pools shut out from every star all the green summer to forlorn cascades among the windings of the mountain brooks unfading recollections at this hour the heart is almost mine with which i felt from some hilltop on sunny afternoons the kite high up among the fleecy clouds pull at its rein like an impatient courser or from the meadows sent on gusty days beheld her breast the wind then suddenly dashd headlong and rejected by the storm  ye lowly cottages in which we dwelt a ministration of your own was yours a sanctity a safeguard and a love can i forget you being as ye were so beautiful among the pleasant fields in which ye stood or can i here forget the plain and seemly countenance with which ye dealt out your plain comforts yet had ye delights and exultations of your own eager and never weary we pursued our home amusements by the warm peatfire at evening when with pencil and with slate in square divisions parcelld out and all with crosses and with cyphers scribbled oer we schemed and puzzled head opposed to head in strife too humble to be named in verse or round the naked table snowwhite deal cherry or maple sate in close array and to the combat lu or whist led on thickribbed army not as in the world neglected and ungratefully thrown by even for the very service they had wrought but husbanded through many a long campaign uncouth assemblage was it where no few had changed their functions some plebeian cards which fate beyond the promise of their birth had glorified and calld to represent the persons of departed potentates oh with what echoes on the board they fell ironic diamonds clubs hearts diamonds spades a congregation piteously akin cheap matter did they give to boyish wit those sooty knaves precipitated down with scoffs and taunts like vulcan out of heaven the paramount ace a moon in her eclipse queens gleaming through their splendours last decay and monarchs surly at the wrongs sustaind by royal visages meanwhile abroad the heavy rain was falling or the frost raged bitterly with keen and silent tooth and interrupting oft the impassiond game from esthwaites neighbouring lake the splitting ice while it sank down towards the water sent among the meadows and the hills its long and dismal yellings like the noise of wolves when they are howling round the bothnic main  nor sedulous as i have been to trace how nature by extrinsic passion first peopled my mind with beauteous forms or grand and made me love them may i well forget how other pleasures have been mine and joys of subtler origin how i have felt not seldom even in that tempestuous time those hallowd and pure motions of the sense which seem in their simplicity to own an intellectual charm that calm delight which if i err not surely must belong to those firstborn affinities that fit our new existence to existing things and in our dawn of being constitute the bond of union betwixt life and joy  yes i remember when the changeful earth and twice five seasons on my mind had stampd the faces of the moving year even then a child i held unconscious intercourse with the eternal beauty drinking in a pure organic pleasure from the lines of curling mist or from the level plain of waters colourd by the steady clouds  the sands of westmoreland the creeks and bays of cumbrias rocky limits they can tell how when the sea threw off his evening shade and to the shepherds huts beneath the crags did send sweet notice of the rising moon how i have stood to fancies such as these engrafted in the tenderness of thought a stranger linking with the spectacle no conscious memory of a kindred sight and bringing with me no peculiar sense of quietness or peace yet i have stood even while mine eye has movd oer three long leagues of shining water gathering as it seemd through every hairbreadth of that field of light new pleasure like a bee among the flowers  thus often in those fits of vulgar joy which through all seasons on a childs pursuits are prompt attendants mid that giddy bliss which like a tempest works along the blood and is forgotten even then i felt gleams like the flashing of a shield the earth and common face of nature spake to me rememberable things sometimes tis true by chance collisions and quaint accidents like those illsorted unions work supposd of evilminded fairies yet not vain nor profitless if haply they impressd collateral objects and appearances albeit lifeless then and doomd to sleep until maturer seasons calld them forth to impregnate and to elevate the mind and if the vulgar joy by its own weight wearied itself out of the memory the scenes which were a witness of that joy remained in their substantial lineaments depicted on the brain and to the eye were visible a daily sight and thus by the impressive discipline of fear by pleasure and repeated happiness so frequently repeated and by force of obscure feelings representative of joys that were forgotten these same scenes so beauteous and majestic in themselves though yet the day was distant did at length become habitually dear and all their hues and forms were by invisible links allied to the affections  i began my story early feeling as i fear the weakness of a human love for days disownd by memory ere the birth of spring planting my snowdrops among winter snows nor will it seem to thee my friend so prompt in sympathy that i have lengthend out with fond and feeble tongue a tedious tale meanwhile my hope has been that i might fetch invigorating thoughts from former years might fix the wavering balance of my wind and haply meet reproaches too whose power may spur me on in manhood now mature to honorable toil yet should these hopes be vain and thus should neither i be taught to understand myself nor thou to know with better knowledge how the heart was framd of him thou lovest need i dread from thee harsh judgments if i am so loth to quit those recollected hours that have the charm of visionary things and lovely forms and sweet sensations that throw back our life and almost make our infancy itself a visible scene on which the sun is shining  one end hereby at least hath been attaind my mind hath been revived and if this mood desert me not i will forthwith bring down through later years the story of my life the road lies plain before me tis a theme single and of determined bounds and hence i chuse it rather at this time than work of ampler or more varied argument
