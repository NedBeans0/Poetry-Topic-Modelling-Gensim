i heard an angel singing when the day was springing mercy pity peace is the worlds release  thus he sung all day over the new mown hay till the sun went down and haycocks looked brown  i heard a devil curse over the heath amp the furze mercy could be no more if there was nobody poor  and pity no more could be if all were as happy as we at his curse the sun went down and the heavens gave a frown  down pourd the heavy rain over the new reapd grain and miseries increase is mercy pity peace
