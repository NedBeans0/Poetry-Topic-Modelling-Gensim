my heart aches and a drowsy numbness pains my sense as though of hemlock i had drunk or emptied some dull opiate to the drains one minute past and lethewards had sunk tis not through envy of thy happy lot but being too happy in thine happiness that thou lightwinged dryad of the trees in some melodious plot of beechen green and shadows numberless singest of summer in fullthroated ease  o for a draught of vintage that hath been coold a long age in the deepdelved earth tasting of flora and the country green dance and proven√ßal song and sunburnt mirth o for a beaker full of the warm south full of the true the blushful hippocrene with beaded bubbles winking at the brim and purplestained mouth that i might drink and leave the world unseen and with thee fade away into the forest dim  fade far away dissolve and quite forget what thou among the leaves hast never known the weariness the fever and the fret here where men sit and hear each other groan where palsy shakes a few sad last gray hairs where youth grows pale and spectrethin and dies where but to think is to be full of sorrow and leadeneyed despairs where beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes or new love pine at them beyond tomorrow  away away for i will fly to thee not charioted by bacchus and his pards but on the viewless wings of poesy though the dull brain perplexes and retards already with thee tender is the night and haply the queenmoon is on her throne clusterd around by all her starry fays but here there is no light save what from heaven is with the breezes blown through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways  i cannot see what flowers are at my feet nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs but in embalmed darkness guess each sweet wherewith the seasonable month endows the grass the thicket and the fruittree wild white hawthorn and the pastoral eglantine fast fading violets coverd up in leaves and midmays eldest child the coming muskrose full of dewy wine the murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves  darkling i listen and for many a time i have been half in love with easeful death calld him soft names in many a mused rhyme to take into the air my quiet breath now more than ever seems it rich to die to cease upon the midnight with no pain while thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad in such an ecstasy still wouldst thou sing and i have ears in vain to thy high requiem become a sod  thou wast not born for death immortal bird no hungry generations tread thee down the voice i hear this passing night was heard in ancient days by emperor and clown perhaps the selfsame song that found a path through the sad heart of ruth when sick for home she stood in tears amid the alien corn the same that ofttimes hath charmd magic casements opening on the foam of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn  forlorn the very word is like a bell to toll me back from thee to my sole self adieu the fancy cannot cheat so well as she is famd to do deceiving elf adieu adieu thy plaintive anthem fades past the near meadows over the still stream up the hillside and now tis buried deep in the next valleyglades was it a vision or a waking dream fled is that musicdo i wake or sleep
