i saw an old cottage of clay and only of mud was the floor it was all falling into decay and the snow drifted in at the door  yet there a poor family dwelt in a hovel so dismal and rude and though gnawing hunger they felt they had not a morsel of food  the children were crying for bread and to their poor mother theyd run oh give us some breakfast they said alas their poor mother had none  she viewed them with looks of despair she said and im sure it was true tis not for myself that i care but my poor little children for you  o then let the wealthy and gay but see such a hovel as this that in a poor cottage of clay they may know what true misery is and what i may have to bestow i never will squander away while many poor people i know around me are wretched as they
