the day is gone and all its sweets are gone sweet voice sweet lips soft hand and softer breast warm breath light whisper tender semitone bright eyes accomplishd shape and langrous waist faded the flower and all its budded charms faded the sight of beauty from my eyes faded the shape of beauty from my arms faded the voice warmth whiteness paradise  vanishd unseasonably at shut of eve when the dusk holiday  or holinight of fragrantcurtaind love begins to weave the woof of darkness thick for hid delight but as ive read loves missal through today hell let me sleep seeing i fast and pray
