i saw where in the shroud did lurk a curious frame of natures work a flowret crushed in the bud a nameless piece of babyhood was in a cradlecoffin lying extinct with scarce the sense of dying so soon to exchange the imprisoning womb for darker closets of the tomb she did but ope an eye and put a clear beam forth then strait up shut for the long dark neer more to see through glasses of mortality riddle of destiny who can show what thy short visit meant or know what thy errand here below shall we say that nature blind checkd her hand and changed her mind just when she had exactly wrought a finishd pattern without fault could she flag or could she tire or lackd she the promethean fire with her nine moons long workings sickend that should thy little limbs have quickend limbs so firm they seemd to assure life of health and days mature womans self in miniature limbs so fair they might supply themselves now but cold imagery the sculptor to make beauty by or did the sterneyed fate descry that babe or mother one must die so in mercy left the stock and cut the branch to save the shock of young years widowd and the pain when single state comes back again to the lone man who reft of wife thenceforward drags a maimed life the economy of heaven is dark and wisest clerks have missd the mark why human buds like this should fall more brief than fly ephemeral that has his day while shriveld crones stiffen with age to stocks and stones and crabbed use the conscience sears in sinners of an hundred years mothers prattle mothers kiss baby fond thou neer wilt miss rites which custom does impose silver bells and baby clothes coral redder than those lips which pale death did late eclipse music framed for infants glee whistle never tuned for thee though thou wantst not thou shalt have them loving hearts were they which gave them let not one be missing nurse see them laid upon the hearse of infant slain by doom perverse why should kings and nobles have pictured trophies to their grave and we churls to thee deny thy pretty toys with thee to lie a more harmless vanity
