i  i weep for adonaishe is dead oh weep for adonais though our tears thaw not the frost which binds so dear a head and thou sad hour selected from all years to mourn our loss rouse thy obscure compeers and teach them thine own sorrow say with me died adonais till the future dares forget the past his fate and fame shall be an echo and a light unto eternity  ii  where wert thou mighty mother when he lay when thy son lay piercd by the shaft which flies in darkness where was lorn urania when adonais died with veiled eyes mid listening echoes in her paradise she sate while one with soft enamourd breath rekindled all the fading melodies with which like flowers that mock the corse beneath he had adornd and hid the coming bulk of death  iii  oh weep for adonaishe is dead wake melancholy mother wake and weep yet wherefore quench within their burning bed thy fiery tears and let thy loud heart keep like his a mute and uncomplaining sleep for he is gone where all things wise and fair descendoh dream not that the amorous deep will yet restore him to the vital air death feeds on his mute voice and laughs at our despair  iv  most musical of mourners weep again lament anew urania he died who was the sire of an immortal strain blind old and lonely when his countrys pride the priest the slave and the liberticide trampled and mockd with many a loathed rite of lust and blood he went unterrified into the gulf of death but his clear sprite yet reigns oer earth the third among the sons of light  v  most musical of mourners weep anew not all to that bright station dard to climb and happier they their happiness who knew whose tapers yet burn through that night of time in which suns perishd others more sublime struck by the envious wrath of man or god have sunk extinct in their refulgent prime and some yet live treading the thorny road which leads through toil and hate to fames serene abode  vi  but now thy youngest dearest one has perishd the nursling of thy widowhood who grew like a pale flower by some sad maiden cherishd and fed with truelove tears instead of dew most musical of mourners weep anew thy extreme hope the loveliest and the last the bloom whose petals nippd before they blew died on the promise of the fruit is waste the broken lily liesthe storm is overpast  vii  to that high capital where kingly death keeps his pale court in beauty and decay he came and bought with price of purest breath a grave among the eternalcome away haste while the vault of blue italian day is yet his fitting charnelroof while still he lies as if in dewy sleep he lay awake him not surely he takes his fill of deep and liquid rest forgetful of all ill  viii  he will awake no more oh never more within the twilight chamber spreads apace the shadow of white death and at the door invisible corruption waits to trace his extreme way to her dim dwellingplace the eternal hunger sits but pity and awe soothe her pale rage nor dares she to deface so fair a prey till darkness and the law of change shall oer his sleep the mortal curtain draw  ix  oh weep for adonais the quick dreams the passionwinged ministers of thought who were his flocks whom near the living streams of his young spirit he fed and whom he taught the love which was its music wander not wander no more from kindling brain to brain but droop there whence they sprung and mourn their lot round the cold heart where after their sweet pain they neer will gather strength or find a home again  x  and one with trembling hands clasps his cold head and fans him with her moonlight wings and cries our love our hope our sorrow is not dead see on the silken fringe of his faint eyes like dew upon a sleeping flower there lies a tear some dream has loosend from his brain lost angel of a ruind paradise she knew not twas her own as with no stain she faded like a cloud which had outwept its rain  xi  one from a lucid urn of starry dew washd his light limbs as if embalming them another clippd her profuse locks and threw the wreath upon him like an anadem which frozen tears instead of pearls begem another in her wilful grief would break her bow and winged reeds as if to stem a greater loss with one which was more weak and dull the barbed fire against his frozen cheek  xii  another splendour on his mouth alit that mouth whence it was wont to draw the breath which gave it strength to pierce the guarded wit and pass into the panting heart beneath with lightning and with music the damp death quenchd its caress upon his icy lips and as a dying meteor stains a wreath of moonlight vapour which the cold night clips it flushd through his pale limbs and passd to its eclipse  xiii  and others came    desires and adorations winged persuasions and veild destinies splendours and glooms and glimmering incarnations of hopes and fears and twilight phantasies and sorrow with her family of sighs and pleasure blind with tears led by the gleam of her own dying smile instead of eyes came in slow pomp the moving pomp might seem like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream  xiv  all he had lovd and moulded into thought from shape and hue and odour and sweet sound lamented adonais morning sought her eastern watchtower and her hair unbound wet with the tears which should adorn the ground dimmd the aÃ«real eyes that kindle day afar the melancholy thunder moand pale ocean in unquiet slumber lay and the wild winds flew round sobbing in their dismay  xv  lost echo sits amid the voiceless mountains and feeds her grief with his rememberd lay and will no more reply to winds or fountains or amorous birds perchd on the young green spray or herdsmans horn or bell at closing day since she can mimic not his lips more dear than those for whose disdain she pind away into a shadow of all sounds a drear murmur between their songs is all the woodmen hear  xvi  grief made the young spring wild and she threw down her kindling buds as if she autumn were or they dead leaves since her delight is flown for whom should she have wakd the sullen year to phoebus was not hyacinth so dear nor to himself narcissus as to both thou adonais wan they stand and sere amid the faint companions of their youth with dew all turnd to tears odour to sighing ruth  xvii  thy spirits sister the lorn nightingale mourns not her mate with such melodious pain not so the eagle who like thee could scale heaven and could nourish in the suns domain her mighty youth with morning doth complain soaring and screaming round her empty nest as albion wails for thee the curse of cain light on his head who piercd thy innocent breast and scard the angel soul that was its earthly guest  xviii  ah woe is me winter is come and gone but grief returns with the revolving year the airs and streams renew their joyous tone the ants the bees the swallows reappear fresh leaves and flowers deck the dead seasons bier the amorous birds now pair in every brake and build their mossy homes in field and brere and the green lizard and the golden snake like unimprisond flames out of their trance awake  xix  through wood and stream and field and hill and ocean a quickening life from the earths heart has burst as it has ever done with change and motion from the great morning of the world when first god dawnd on chaos in its stream immersd the lamps of heaven flash with a softer light all baser things pant with lifes sacred thirst diffuse themselves and spend in loves delight the beauty and the joy of their renewed might  xx  the leprous corpse touchd by this spirit tender exhales itself in flowers of gentle breath like incarnations of the stars when splendour is changd to fragrance they illumine death and mock the merry worm that wakes beneath nought we know dies shall that alone which knows be as a sword consumd before the sheath by sightless lightningthe intense atom glows a moment then is quenchd in a most cold repose  xxi  alas that all we lovd of him should be but for our grief as if it had not been and grief itself be mortal woe is me whence are we and why are we of what scene the actors or spectators great and mean meet massd in death who lends what life must borrow as long as skies are blue and fields are green evening must usher night night urge the morrow month follow month with woe and year wake year to sorrow  xxii  he will awake no more oh never more wake thou cried misery childless mother rise out of thy sleep and slake in thy hearts core a wound more fierce than his with tears and sighs and all the dreams that watchd uranias eyes and all the echoes whom their sisters song had held in holy silence cried arise swift as a thought by the snake memory stung from her ambrosial rest the fading splendour sprung  xxiii  she rose like an autumnal night that springs out of the east and follows wild and drear the golden day which on eternal wings even as a ghost abandoning a bier had left the earth a corpse sorrow and fear so struck so rousd so rapt urania so saddend round her like an atmosphere of stormy mist so swept her on her way even to the mournful place where adonais lay  xxiv  out of her secret paradise she sped through camps and cities rough with stone and steel and human hearts which to her aery tread yielding not wounded the invisible palms of her tender feet whereer they fell and barbed tongues and thoughts more sharp than they rent the soft form they never could repel whose sacred blood like the young tears of may pavd with eternal flowers that undeserving way  xxv  in the deathchamber for a moment death shamd by the presence of that living might blushd to annihilation and the breath revisited those lips and lifes pale light flashd through those limbs so late her dear delight leave me not wild and drear and comfortless as silent lightning leaves the starless night leave me not cried urania her distress rousd death death rose and smild and met her vain caress  xxvi  stay yet awhile speak to me once again kiss me so long but as a kiss may live and in my heartless breast and burning brain that word that kiss shall all thoughts else survive with food of saddest memory kept alive now thou art dead as if it were a part of thee my adonais i would give all that i am to be as thou now art but i am chaind to time and cannot thence depart  xxvii  o gentle child beautiful as thou wert why didst thou leave the trodden paths of men too soon and with weak hands though mighty heart dare the unpasturd dragon in his den defenceless as thou wert oh where was then wisdom the mirrord shield or scorn the spear or hadst thou waited the full cycle when thy spirit should have filld its crescent sphere the monsters of lifes waste had fled from thee like deer  xxviii  the herded wolves bold only to pursue the obscene ravens clamorous oer the dead the vultures to the conquerors banner true who feed where desolation first has fed and whose wings rain contagion how they fled when like apollo from his golden bow the pythian of the age one arrow sped and smild the spoilers tempt no second blow they fawn on the proud feet that spurn them lying low  xxix  the sun comes forth and many reptiles spawn he sets and each ephemeral insect then is gatherd into death without a dawn and the immortal stars awake again so is it in the world of living men a godlike mind soars forth in its delight making earth bare and veiling heaven and when it sinks the swarms that dimmd or shard its light leave to its kindred lamps the spirits awful night  xxx  thus ceasd she and the mountain shepherds came their garlands sere their magic mantles rent the pilgrim of eternity whose fame over his living head like heaven is bent an early but enduring monument came veiling all the lightnings of his song in sorrow from her wilds ierne sent the sweetest lyrist of her saddest wrong and love taught grief to fall like music from his tongue  xxxi  midst others of less note came one frail form a phantom among men companionless as the last cloud of an expiring storm whose thunder is its knell he as i guess had gazd on natures naked loveliness actaeonlike and now he fled astray with feeble steps oer the worlds wilderness and his own thoughts along that rugged way pursud like raging hounds their father and their prey  xxxii  a pardlike spirit beautiful and swift a love in desolation maskda power girt round with weaknessit can scarce uplift the weight of the superincumbent hour it is a dying lamp a falling shower a breaking billow even whilst we speak is it not broken on the withering flower the killing sun smiles brightly on a cheek the life can burn in blood even while the heart may break  xxxiii  his head was bound with pansies overblown and faded violets white and pied and blue and a light spear toppd with a cypress cone round whose rude shaft dark ivytresses grew yet dripping with the forests noonday dew vibrated as the everbeating heart shook the weak hand that graspd it of that crew he came the last neglected and apart a herdabandond deer struck by the hunters dart  xxxiv  all stood aloof and at his partial moan smild through their tears well knew that gentle band who in anothers fate now wept his own as in the accents of an unknown land he sung new sorrow sad urania scannd the strangers mien and murmurd who art thou he answerd not but with a sudden hand made bare his branded and ensanguind brow which was like cains or christsoh that it should be so  xxxv  what softer voice is hushd over the dead athwart what brow is that dark mantle thrown what form leans sadly oer the white deathbed in mockery of monumental stone the heavy heart heaving without a moan if it be he who gentlest of the wise taught soothd lovd honourd the departed one let me not vex with inharmonious sighs the silence of that hearts accepted sacrifice  xxxvi  our adonais has drunk poisonoh what deaf and viperous murderer could crown lifes early cup with such a draught of woe the nameless worm would now itself disown it felt yet could escape the magic tone whose prelude held all envy hate and wrong but what was howling in one breast alone silent with expectation of the song whose masters hand is cold whose silver lyre unstrung  xxxvii  live thou whose infamy is not thy fame live fear no heavier chastisement from me thou noteless blot on a rememberd name but be thyself and know thyself to be and ever at thy season be thou free to spill the venom when thy fangs oerflow remorse and selfcontempt shall cling to thee hot shame shall burn upon thy secret brow and like a beaten hound tremble thou shaltas now  xxxviii  nor let us weep that our delight is fled far from these carrion kites that scream below he wakes or sleeps with the enduring dead thou canst not soar where he is sitting now dust to the dust but the pure spirit shall flow back to the burning fountain whence it came a portion of the eternal which must glow through time and change unquenchably the same whilst thy cold embers choke the sordid hearth of shame  xxxix  peace peace he is not dead he doth not sleep he hath awakend from the dream of life tis we who lost in stormy visions keep with phantoms an unprofitable strife and in mad trance strike with our spirits knife invulnerable nothingswe decay like corpses in a charnel fear and grief convulse us and consume us day by day and cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay  xl  he has outsoard the shadow of our night envy and calumny and hate and pain and that unrest which men miscall delight can touch him not and torture not again from the contagion of the worlds slow stain he is secure and now can never mourn a heart grown cold a head grown gray in vain nor when the spirits self has ceasd to burn with sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn  xli  he lives he wakestis death is dead not he mourn not for adonais thou young dawn turn all thy dew to splendour for from thee the spirit thou lamentest is not gone ye caverns and ye forests cease to moan cease ye faint flowers and fountains and thou air which like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst thrown oer the abandond earth now leave it bare even to the joyous stars which smile on its despair  xlii  he is made one with nature there is heard his voice in all her music from the moan of thunder to the song of nights sweet bird he is a presence to be felt and known in darkness and in light from herb and stone spreading itself whereer that power may move which has withdrawn his being to its own which wields the world with neverwearied love sustains it from beneath and kindles it above  xliii  he is a portion of the loveliness which once he made more lovely he doth bear his part while the one spirits plastic stress sweeps through the dull dense world compelling there all new successions to the forms they wear torturing th unwilling dross that checks its flight to its own likeness as each mass may bear and bursting in its beauty and its might from trees and beasts and men into the heavens light  xliv  the splendours of the firmament of time may be eclipsd but are extinguishd not like stars to their appointed height they climb and death is a low mist which cannot blot the brightness it may veil when lofty thought lifts a young heart above its mortal lair and love and life contend in it for what shall be its earthly doom the dead live there and move like winds of light on dark and stormy air  xlv  the inheritors of unfulfilld renown rose from their thrones built beyond mortal thought far in the unapparent chatterton rose pale his solemn agony had not yet faded from him sidney as he fought and as he fell and as he livd and lovd sublimely mild a spirit without spot arose and lucan by his death approvd oblivion as they rose shrank like a thing reprovd  xlvi  and many more whose names on earth are dark but whose transmitted effluence cannot die so long as fire outlives the parent spark rose robd in dazzling immortality thou art become as one of us they cry it was for thee yon kingless sphere has long swung blind in unascended majesty silent alone amid a heaven of song assume thy winged throne thou vesper of our throng  xlvii  who mourns for adonais oh come forth fond wretch and know thyself and him aright clasp with thy panting soul the pendulous earth as from a centre dart thy spirits light beyond all worlds until its spacious might satiate the void circumference then shrink even to a point within our day and night and keep thy heart light lest it make thee sink when hope has kindled hope and lurd thee to the brink  xlviii  or go to rome which is the sepulchre oh not of him but of our joy tis nought that ages empires and religions there lie buried in the ravage they have wrought for such as he can lendthey borrow not glory from those who made the world their prey and he is gatherd to the kings of thought who wagd contention with their times decay and of the past are all that cannot pass away  xlix  go thou to romeat once the paradise the grave the city and the wilderness and where its wrecks like shatterd mountains rise and flowering weeds and fragrant copses dress the bones of desolations nakedness pass till the spirit of the spot shall lead thy footsteps to a slope of green access where like an infants smile over the dead a light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread  l  and gray walls moulder round on which dull time feeds like slow fire upon a hoary brand and one keen pyramid with wedge sublime pavilioning the dust of him who plannd this refuge for his memory doth stand like flame transformd to marble and beneath a field is spread on which a newer band have pitchd in heavens smile their camp of death welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguishd breath  li  here pause these graves are all too young as yet to have outgrown the sorrow which consignd its charge to each and if the seal is set here on one fountain of a mourning mind break it not thou too surely shalt thou find thine own well full if thou returnest home of tears and gall from the worlds bitter wind seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb what adonais is why fear we to become  lii  the one remains the many change and pass heavens light forever shines earths shadows fly life like a dome of manycolourd glass stains the white radiance of eternity until death tramples it to fragmentsdie if thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek follow where all is fledromes azure sky flowers ruins statues music words are weak the glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak  liii  why linger why turn back why shrink my heart thy hopes are gone before from all things here they have departed thou shouldst now depart a light is passd from the revolving year and man and woman and what still is dear attracts to crush repels to make thee wither the soft sky smiles the low wind whispers near tis adonais calls oh hasten thither no more let life divide what death can join together  liv  that light whose smile kindles the universe that beauty in which all things work and move that benediction which the eclipsing curse of birth can quench not that sustaining love which through the web of being blindly wove by man and beast and earth and air and sea burns bright or dim as each are mirrors of the fire for which all thirst now beams on me consuming the last clouds of cold mortality  lv  the breath whose might i have invokd in song descends on me my spirits bark is driven far from the shore far from the trembling throng whose sails were never to the tempest given the massy earth and sphered skies are riven i am borne darkly fearfully afar whilst burning through the inmost veil of heaven the soul of adonais like a star beacons from the abode where the eternal are
