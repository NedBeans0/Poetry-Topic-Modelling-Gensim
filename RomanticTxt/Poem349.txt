it flows through old hushed egypt and its sands like some grave mighty thought threading a dream and times and things as in that vision seem keeping along it their eternal stands caves pillars pyramids the shepherd bands that roamed through the young world the glory extreme of high sesostris and that southern beam the laughing queen that caught the worlds great hands  then comes a mightier silence stern and strong as of a world left empty of its throng and the void weighs on us and then we wake and hear the fruitful stream lapsing along twixt villages and think how we shall take our own calm journey on for human sake
