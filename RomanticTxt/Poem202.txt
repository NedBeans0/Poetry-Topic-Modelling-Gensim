st agnes eveah bitter chill it was the owl for all his feathers was acold the hare limpd trembling through the frozen grass and silent was the flock in woolly fold numb were the beadsmans fingers while he told his rosary and while his frosted breath like pious incense from a censer old seemd taking flight for heaven without a death past the sweet virgins picture while his prayer he saith  his prayer he saith this patient holy man then takes his lamp and riseth from his knees and back returneth meagre barefoot wan along the chapel aisle by slow degrees the sculpturd dead on each side seem to freeze emprisond in black purgatorial rails knights ladies praying in dumb oratries he passeth by and his weak spirit fails to think how they may ache in icy hoods and mails  northward he turneth through a little door and scarce three steps ere musics golden tongue flatterd to tears this aged man and poor but noalready had his deathbell rung the joys of all his life were said and sung his was harsh penance on st agnes eve another way he went and soon among rough ashes sat he for his souls reprieve and all night kept awake for sinners sake to grieve  that ancient beadsman heard the prelude soft and so it chancd for many a door was wide from hurry to and fro soon up aloft the silver snarling trumpets gan to chide the level chambers ready with their pride were glowing to receive a thousand guests the carved angels ever eagereyed stard where upon their heads the cornice rests with hair blown back and wings put crosswise on their breasts  at length burst in the argent revelry with plume tiara and all rich array numerous as shadows haunting faerily the brain new stuffd in youth with triumphs gay of old romance these let us wish away and turn solethoughted to one lady there whose heart had brooded all that wintry day on love and wingd st agnes saintly care as she had heard old dames full many times declare  they told her how upon st agnes eve young virgins might have visions of delight and soft adorings from their loves receive upon the honeyd middle of the night if ceremonies due they did aright as supperless to bed they must retire and couch supine their beauties lily white nor look behind nor sideways but require of heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire  full of this whim was thoughtful madeline the music yearning like a god in pain she scarcely heard her maiden eyes divine fixd on the floor saw many a sweeping train pass byshe heeded not at all in vain came many a tiptoe amorous cavalier and back retird not coold by high disdain but she saw not her heart was otherwhere she sighd for agnes dreams the sweetest of the year  she dancd along with vague regardless eyes anxious her lips her breathing quick and short the hallowd hour was near at hand she sighs amid the timbrels and the throngd resort of whisperers in anger or in sport mid looks of love defiance hate and scorn hoodwinkd with faery fancy all amort save to st agnes and her lambs unshorn and all the bliss to be before tomorrow morn  so purposing each moment to retire she lingerd still meantime across the moors had come young porphyro with heart on fire for madeline beside the portal doors buttressd from moonlight stands he and implores all saints to give him sight of madeline but for one moment in the tedious hours that he might gaze and worship all unseen perchance speak kneel touch kissin sooth such things have been  he ventures in let no buzzd whisper tell all eyes be muffled or a hundred swords will storm his heart loves fevrous citadel for him those chambers held barbarian hordes hyena foemen and hotblooded lords whose very dogs would execrations howl against his lineage not one breast affords him any mercy in that mansion foul save one old beldame weak in body and in soul  ah happy chance the aged creature came shuffling along with ivoryheaded wand to where he stood hid from the torchs flame behind a broad halfpillar far beyond the sound of merriment and chorus bland he startled her but soon she knew his face and graspd his fingers in her palsied hand saying mercy porphyro hie thee from this place they are all here tonight the whole bloodthirsty race  get hence get hence theres dwarfish hildebrand he had a fever late and in the fit he cursed thee and thine both house and land then theres that old lord maurice not a whit more tame for his gray hairsalas me flit flit like a ghost awayah gossip dear were safe enough here in this armchair sit and tell me howgood saints not here not here follow me child or else these stones will be thy bier  he followd through a lowly arched way brushing the cobwebs with his lofty plume and as she mutterd wellawelladay he found him in a little moonlight room pale latticd chill and silent as a tomb now tell me where is madeline said he o tell me angela by the holy loom which none but secret sisterhood may see when they st agnes wool are weaving piously  st agnes ah it is st agnes eve yet men will murder upon holy days thou must hold water in a witchs sieve and be liegelord of all the elves and fays to venture so it fills me with amaze to see thee porphyrost agnes eve gods help my lady fair the conjuror plays this very night good angels her deceive but let me laugh awhile ive mickle time to grieve  feebly she laugheth in the languid moon while porphyro upon her face doth look like puzzled urchin on an aged crone who keepeth closd a wondrous riddlebook as spectacled she sits in chimney nook but soon his eyes grew brilliant when she told his ladys purpose and he scarce could brook tears at the thought of those enchantments cold and madeline asleep in lap of legends old  sudden a thought came like a fullblown rose flushing his brow and in his pained heart made purple riot then doth he propose a stratagem that makes the beldame start a cruel man and impious thou art sweet lady let her pray and sleep and dream alone with her good angels far apart from wicked men like thee go goi deem thou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem  i will not harm her by all saints i swear quoth porphyro o may i neer find grace when my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer if one of her soft ringlets i displace or look with ruffian passion in her face good angela believe me by these tears or i will even in a moments space awake with horrid shout my foemens ears and beard them though they be more fangd than wolves and bears  ah why wilt thou affright a feeble soul a poor weak palsystricken churchyard thing whose passingbell may ere the midnight toll whose prayers for thee each morn and evening were never missdthus plaining doth she bring a gentler speech from burning porphyro so woful and of such deep sorrowing that angela gives promise she will do whatever he shall wish betide her weal or woe  which was to lead him in close secrecy even to madelines chamber and there hide him in a closet of such privacy that he might see her beauty unespyd and win perhaps that night a peerless bride while legiond faeries pacd the coverlet and pale enchantment held her sleepyeyd never on such a night have lovers met since merlin paid his demon all the monstrous debt  it shall be as thou wishest said the dame all cates and dainties shall be stored there quickly on this feastnight by the tambour frame her own lute thou wilt see no time to spare for i am slow and feeble and scarce dare on such a catering trust my dizzy head wait here my child with patience kneel in prayer the while ah thou must needs the lady wed or may i never leave my grave among the dead  so saying she hobbled off with busy fear the lovers endless minutes slowly passd the dame returnd and whisperd in his ear to follow her with aged eyes aghast from fright of dim espial safe at last through many a dusky gallery they gain the maidens chamber silken hushd and chaste where porphyro took covert pleasd amain his poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain  her faltring hand upon the balustrade old angela was feeling for the stair when madeline st agnes charmed maid rose like a missiond spirit unaware with silver tapers light and pious care she turnd and down the aged gossip led to a safe level matting now prepare young porphyro for gazing on that bed she comes she comes again like ringdove frayd and fled  out went the taper as she hurried in its little smoke in pallid moonshine died she closd the door she panted all akin to spirits of the air and visions wide no uttered syllable or woe betide but to her heart her heart was voluble paining with eloquence her balmy side as though a tongueless nightingale should swell her throat in vain and die heartstifled in her dell  a casement high and triplearchd there was all garlanded with carven imagries of fruits and flowers and bunches of knotgrass and diamonded with panes of quaint device innumerable of stains and splendid dyes as are the tigermoths deepdamaskd wings and in the midst mong thousand heraldries and twilight saints and dim emblazonings a shielded scutcheon blushd with blood of queens and kings  full on this casement shone the wintry moon and threw warm gules on madelines fair breast as down she knelt for heavens grace and boon rosebloom fell on her hands together prest and on her silver cross soft amethyst and on her hair a glory like a saint she seemd a splendid angel newly drest save wings for heavenporphyro grew faint she knelt so pure a thing so free from mortal taint  anon his heart revives her vespers done of all its wreathed pearls her hair she frees unclasps her warmed jewels one by one loosens her fragrant boddice by degrees her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees halfhidden like a mermaid in seaweed pensive awhile she dreams awake and sees in fancy fair st agnes in her bed but dares not look behind or all the charm is fled  soon trembling in her soft and chilly nest in sort of wakeful swoon perplexd she lay until the poppied warmth of sleep oppressd her soothed limbs and soul fatigued away flown like a thought until the morrowday blissfully havend both from joy and pain claspd like a missal where swart paynims pray blinded alike from sunshine and from rain as though a rose should shut and be a bud again  stoln to this paradise and so entranced porphyro gazd upon her empty dress and listend to her breathing if it chanced to wake into a slumberous tenderness which when he heard that minute did he bless and breathd himself then from the closet crept noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness and over the hushd carpet silent stept and tween the curtains peepd where lohow fast she slept  then by the bedside where the faded moon made a dim silver twilight soft he set a table and half anguishd threw thereon a cloth of woven crimson gold and jet o for some drowsy morphean amulet the boisterous midnight festive clarion the kettledrum and farheard clarinet affray his ears though but in dying tone the hall door shuts again and all the noise is gone  and still she slept an azurelidded sleep in blanched linen smooth and lavenderd while he forth from the closet brought a heap of candied apple quince and plum and gourd with jellies soother than the creamy curd and lucent syrops tinct with cinnamon manna and dates in argosy transferrd from fez and spiced dainties every one from silken samarcand to cedard lebanon  these delicates he heapd with glowing hand on golden dishes and in baskets bright of wreathed silver sumptuous they stand in the retired quiet of the night filling the chilly room with perfume light and now my love my seraph fair awake thou art my heaven and i thine eremite open thine eyes for meek st agnes sake or i shall drowse beside thee so my soul doth ache  thus whispering his warm unnerved arm sank in her pillow shaded was her dream by the dusk curtainstwas a midnight charm impossible to melt as iced stream the lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies it seemd he never never could redeem from such a stedfast spell his ladys eyes so musd awhile entoild in woofed phantasies  awakening up he took her hollow lute tumultuousand in chords that tenderest be he playd an ancient ditty long since mute in provence calld la belle dame sans mercy close to her ear touching the melody wherewith disturbd she utterd a soft moan he ceasdshe panted quickand suddenly her blue affrayed eyes wide open shone upon his knees he sank pale as smoothsculptured stone  her eyes were open but she still beheld now wide awake the vision of her sleep there was a painful change that nigh expelld the blisses of her dream so pure and deep at which fair madeline began to weep and moan forth witless words with many a sigh while still her gaze on porphyro would keep who knelt with joined hands and piteous eye fearing to move or speak she lookd so dreamingly  ah porphyro said she but even now thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear made tuneable with every sweetest vow and those sad eyes were spiritual and clear how changd thou art how pallid chill and drear give me that voice again my porphyro those looks immortal those complainings dear oh leave me not in this eternal woe for if thy diest my love i know not where to go  beyond a mortal man impassiond far at these voluptuous accents he arose ethereal flushd and like a throbbing star seen mid the sapphire heavens deep repose into her dream he melted as the rose blendeth its odour with the violet solution sweet meantime the frostwind blows like loves alarum pattering the sharp sleet against the windowpanes st agnes moon hath set  tis dark quick pattereth the flawblown sleet this is no dream my bride my madeline tis dark the iced gusts still rave and beat no dream alas alas and woe is mine porphyro will leave me here to fade and pine cruel what traitor could thee hither bring i curse not for my heart is lost in thine though thou forsakest a deceived thing a dove forlorn and lost with sick unpruned wing  my madeline sweet dreamer lovely bride say may i be for aye thy vassal blest thy beautys shield heartshapd and vermeil dyed ah silver shrine here will i take my rest after so many hours of toil and quest a famishd pilgrimsavd by miracle though i have found i will not rob thy nest saving of thy sweet self if thou thinkst well to trust fair madeline to no rude infidel  hark tis an elfinstorm from faery land of haggard seeming but a boon indeed arisearise the morning is at hand the bloated wassaillers will never heed let us away my love with happy speed there are no ears to hear or eyes to see drownd all in rhenish and the sleepy mead awake arise my love and fearless be for oer the southern moors i have a home for thee  she hurried at his words beset with fears for there were sleeping dragons all around at glaring watch perhaps with ready spears down the wide stairs a darkling way they found in all the house was heard no human sound a chaindroopd lamp was flickering by each door the arras rich with horseman hawk and hound flutterd in the besieging winds uproar and the long carpets rose along the gusty floor  they glide like phantoms into the wide hall like phantoms to the iron porch they glide where lay the porter in uneasy sprawl with a huge empty flaggon by his side the wakeful bloodhound rose and shook his hide but his sagacious eye an inmate owns by one and one the bolts full easy slide the chains lie silent on the footworn stones the key turns and the door upon its hinges groans  and they are gone ay ages long ago these lovers fled away into the storm that night the baron dreamt of many a woe and all his warriorguests with shade and form of witch and demon and large coffinworm were long benightmard angela the old died palsytwitchd with meagre face deform the beadsman after thousand aves told for aye unsought for slept among his ashes cold
