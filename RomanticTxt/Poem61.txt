i bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers from the seas and the streams i bear light shade for the leaves when laid in their noonday dreams from my wings are shaken the dews that waken the sweet buds every one when rocked to rest on their mothers breast as she dances about the sun i wield the flail of the lashing hail and whiten the green plains under and then again i dissolve it in rain and laugh as i pass in thunder  i sift the snow on the mountains below and their great pines groan aghast and all the night tis my pillow white while i sleep in the arms of the blast sublime on the towers of my skiey bowers lightning my pilot sits in a cavern under is fettered the thunder it struggles and howls at fits over earth and ocean with gentle motion this pilot is guiding me lured by the love of the genii that move in the depths of the purple sea over the rills and the crags and the hills over the lakes and the plains wherever he dream under mountain or stream the spirit he loves remains and i all the while bask in heavens blue smile whilst he is dissolving in rains  the sanguine sunrise with his meteor eyes and his burning plumes outspread leaps on the back of my sailing rack when the morning star shines dead as on the jag of a mountain crag which an earthquake rocks and swings an eagle alit one moment may sit in the light of its golden wings and when sunset may breathe from the lit sea beneath its ardours of rest and of love and the crimson pall of eve may fall from the depth of heaven above with wings folded i rest on mine aëry nest as still as a brooding dove  that orbèd maiden with white fire laden whom mortals call the moon glides glimmering oer my fleecelike floor by the midnight breezes strewn and wherever the beat of her unseen feet which only the angels hear may have broken the woof of my tents thin roof the stars peep behind her and peer and i laugh to see them whirl and flee like a swarm of golden bees when i widen the rent in my windbuilt tent till calm the rivers lakes and seas like strips of the sky fallen through me on high are each paved with the moon and these  i bind the suns throne with a burning zone and the moons with a girdle of pearl the volcanoes are dim and the stars reel and swim when the whirlwinds my banner unfurl from cape to cape with a bridgelike shape over a torrent sea sunbeamproof i hang like a roof the mountains its columns be the triumphal arch through which i march with hurricane fire and snow when the powers of the air are chained to my chair is the millioncoloured bow the spherefire above its soft colours wove while the moist earth was laughing below  i am the daughter of earth and water and the nursling of the sky i pass through the pores of the ocean and shores i change but i cannot die for after the rain when with never a stain the pavilion of heaven is bare and the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams build up the blue dome of air i silently laugh at my own cenotaph and out of the caverns of rain like a child from the womb like a ghost from the tomb i arise and unbuild it again
