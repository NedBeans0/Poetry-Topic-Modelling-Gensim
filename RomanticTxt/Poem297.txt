the summer and autumn had been so wet that in winter the corn was growing yet twas a piteous sight to see all around the grain lie rotting on the ground  every day the starving poor crowded around bishop hattos door for he had a plentiful lastyears store and all the neighbourhood could tell his granaries were furnishd well  at last bishop hatto appointed a day to quiet the poor without delay he bade them to his great barn repair and they should have food for the winter there  rejoiced such tidings good to hear the poor folk flockd from far and near the great barn was full as it could hold of women and children and young and old  then when he saw it could hold no more bishop hatto he made fast the door and while for mercy on christ they call he set fire to the barn and burnt them all  ifaith tis an excellent bonfire quoth he and the country is greatly obliged to me for ridding it in these times forlorn of rats that only consume the corn  so then to his palace returned he and he sat down to supper merrily and he slept that night like an innocent man but bishop hatto never slept again  in the morning as he enterd the hall where his picture hung against the wall a sweat like death all over him came for the rats had eaten it out of the frame  as he lookd there came a man from his farm he had a countenance white with alarm my lord i opend your granaries this morn and the rats had eaten all your corn  another came running presently and he was pale as pale could be fly my lord bishop fly quoth he ten thousand rats are coming this way the lord forgive you for yesterday  ill go to my tower on the rhine replied he tis the safest place in germany the walls are high and the shores are steep and the stream is strong and the water deep  bishop hatto fearfully hastend away and he crost the rhine without delay and reachd his tower and barrd with care all the windows doors and loopholes there  he laid him down and closed his eyes but soon a scream made him arise he started and saw two eyes of flame on his pillow from whence the screaming came  he listend and lookd it was only the cat and the bishop he grew more fearful for that for she sat screaming mad with fear at the army of rats that were drawing near  for they have swum over the river so deep and they have climbd the shores so steep and up the tower their way is bent to do the work for which they were sent  they are not to be told by the dozen or score by thousands they come and by myriads and more such numbers had never been heard of before such a judgment had never been witnessd of yore  down on his knees the bishop fell and faster and faster his beads did he tell as louder and louder drawing near the gnawing of their teeth he could hear  and in at the windows and in at the door and through the walls helterskelter they pour and down from the ceiling and up through the floor from the right and the left from behind and before from within and without from above and below and all at once to the bishop they go  they have whetted their teeth against the stones and now they pick the bishops bones they gnawd the flesh from every limb for they were sent to do judgment on him
