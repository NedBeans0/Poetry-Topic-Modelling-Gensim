# Poetry-Topic-Modelling-Gensim

This repo contains a Jupyter notebook and datasets (derived from https://www.kaggle.com/tgdivy/poetry-foundation-poems) for a project that generated topic models of three different poetic movements to see if the primary themes and motifs could be identified. The main notebook (Poetry Topic Modelling.ipynb) walks through each step of data mining and model building. LDA takes a few minutes to train with more than 500 iterations (I used 3000 in my final model for the project) so it may take a while to run. If GitHub does not load the notebook properly online, a few refreshes seem to make it show. 

Details regarding parameter tuning and testing can be viewed in the documentation in the dissertation based on this project, included as a PDF in the repo. 

In addition, some fascinating LDA visualisations which show each topic as a 'bubble' in a 2D plane whose distances reflect the differences between each topic are included as HTML files, viewable in a browser. Further details and explorations of what is shown by these visualisations are also included in the report.

I was awarded a first class grade (88%) for this project and its report.
