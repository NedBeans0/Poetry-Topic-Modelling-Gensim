# Poetry-Topic-Modelling-Gensim

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks and datasets (derived from https://www.kaggle.com/tgdivy/poetry-foundation-poems) for a project that generated topic models of three different poetic movements to see if the primary themes and motifs could be identified within the topics. The main notebook walks through each step of data mining and model building. LDA takes a few minutes to train with more than 500 iterations (I used 3000 in my final model for the project) so it may take a while to run.

Details regarding parameter tuning and testing can be viewed in the documentation in the dissertation based on this project, included as a PDF in the repo. 

I was awarded a first class grade (88%) for this project and its report.
