i  along the wilderness road through cumberland gap the black ox hours limped toward sundays sun across a buff clay belt with scrawls of stone where bird and beast quailed in the bosom brush from februarys fang and claw the stars blue white like sheer icicles spired aglow as if the three wise men barged in the east or priests in sackcloth balked the scourge of god  foursquare by the rite of arm and heart and law the scrubby log cabin dared the compass points of rock spring farm mans world gods universe the babel of the circumstance and era the frozen socket of its window stared beyond the spayed crabapple trees to where the skulls of hills the skeletons of barrens lay quiet as time without the watchs tick  not knowing muck and star would vie for him the man tom sank upon axsplit stool hands fisted feet set wide to brace the spirit big shoulders shoved dark hazel eyes glazed by grotesqueries of flame that yawled and danced up up the stickclay chimney while fire imps combed the black and bristling hair the acids of thoughts made of the orby face an etchingplate   ii  near pyrotechnic logs the purling kettle aunt peggy puffed her pipe on gods rich time a granny at a childbed on the border where head and backbone answered the tomahawk her wise old eyes had seen a hundred nancys in travail tread the dark winepress alone her wise old hands had plucked a stubborn breed into the outer world of pitch and toss  the cabin that her myth and mission entered became a castle in which aunt peggy throned a dynasty of grunts and nods and glances the nest the barn the hovel had schooled her in the abc of motherhood and somehow shed lost her ego in the commonweal she sensed so accurately a coming child that rakes dubbed her the st bernard of sex  and now her keyhole look explored tom lincoln beneath the patched homespun the hue and cry of malice until she touched his loneliness the taproot that his fiber gave no tongue then lulling the wife troubled in flesh and mind she eased the sack quilts higher and mused the while theres but one way of coming into the world and seven times seventy ways of leaving it   iii  the woman nancy like a voyager sucked into the seas whale belly by a wreck buoyed to the surface air of consciousness and clutched the solace of her cornhusk bed her dark face sharped in forehead cheekbone chin cuddled in dark brown hair her eyes waxed grayer with wonder of the interlude her beauty and courage choked aunt peggys hyperbole  out of the fog of pain the bog of bygones the bag of cabin cant and tavern tattle she picked the squares to piece tomorrows quilt she puzzled now as then about her father who let wild lucy hanks bundle and carry flesh of his flesh beyond the cumberland gap a strange roof is no roof when imps of fear pilfer the fatherless in blossom time  year in year out the daughter tinkered with the riddle of her birth the mother chided the woman nancy as she had the child hush thee hush thee thy fathers a gentleman the butt of bawd grand jury sunday bonnet lucy driven taught her daughter the word and nancy driven taught her son the word and abraham driven taught his people the word   iv  the man tom bit his fingernails then rammed his pockets with the hector hands that gave raw timber the shape of cabinet and coffin and in his lame speech said aunt peggy listen now that our nancys time is come im haunted by my own nothingness why breed nobodies he tapped the dirt floor with the ironcapped boot that aided fist and skull in border fights  aunt peggy counseled tom you say the say poor joseph probably said in that low stable ere jesus came into this mishmash world she paused then boxed the ears of cynicism its true down in the barnyard blood speaks loud among the hogs the chickens the cows the horses but when it comes to man who knows who knows what greatness feeds down in the lowliest mother  the man tom turned and spat his naked surmise ranged out and out aunt peggys innermost said your father abraham bred like daniel boone conquered a land with gun and ax and plow baptized it in his blood i say ive said whats in a baby is god almightys business how the elders wring it out is worry enough the best the worstits all all human nature   v  the tavern tom remembered the new years eve the clubfoot scholar bagged in old world clothes with arrowy eyes and a hoary mushroom beard an oxford don he hymned the bastilles fall in spite of the hairhung sword his betters set him free to hail new truths in new lands where he seined with slave and master knave and priest and out of all fished up the rights of man  as citizen lincoln asks whats human nature his full mug says a clear mind puts the question which ties the fogey scholar in a knot my new idea fed to his new baby would fetch the new world and the new year peace the sum of anything unriddles the riddle the child whose wet nurse is the motherofall grows like a pine unmarked by rock or wind  to make a new world and a new year plato and jesus begged the boon of little children now citizen lincoln asks whats human nature its what we elders have no baby has it its what our good and bad graft on the neutral its what our rulers feed the boy and girl its what society garbs nature in its a misnomer call it human nurture   vi  aunt peggy hovered closer with flawless rites grown lyrical from habit muffled pain sounds dragged from the bed of cleated poles she hawed tom lincoln as one turns a nag aside then swooped her way even as a setting hen carves a dictatorship from yard to nest and tom again was squeezed into a cell whose inmates were the ghosts of unsuccess  later his memories climbed a gala peak his nancys infare that ran riotous the bear meat venison wild turkey duck the maple sugar hanging for the whiskey the red ham gourds of syrup bowls of honey the wood coal pit with brown and juicy sheep the guzzling fiddling guttling monkeyshining a continent sprawled between that day and this  a havenot on the frontier is no havenot a crusoe without friday has no conscience yet toms grub living gnawed him like the teeth of slavery land titles melancholy he like his forebears visioned a promised land and tidied ways and means to fly the barrens that doomed the flesh to peck to patch to pinch and wrung the soul of joy and beauty dry   vii  the black ox hours limped by and day crawled after white prongs of ice like dinosaur fangs gleamed in the cavernous mouth of rock spring snowbirds shivered and chirped rebellion a cow with jags and gaps chewed emptily hogs squealed in hunger fits and scrags of dogs huddled against the chimney which shoveled smoke dust into the throats and noses of ragged winds kicking up snow in the desert  nancy lay white serene like virgin milk after the udders fury in the pail beneath the sack quilts and the bearskin robe in yellow petticoat and linsey shirt the baby snuggled at her breast and gurgled an anonymity of soft red wrinkles aunt peggy hovering grinned hes sabbathborn remember sundayits redletter day  like ax and helve like scythe and snath the bond held tom and nancy she smiled at his halt smile his titans muss in picking up the baby tom frowned and spat then gulped hes legs all legs aunt peggy beamed long legs can eat up miles tom gloomed the handslook at the axmans hands and nancy mused the hankses dream the lincolns needs such a man to hew and blaze the way
