i hear the halting footsteps of a lass in negro harlem when the night lets fall its veil i see the shapes of girls who pass to bend and barter at desires call ah little dark girls who in slippered feet go prowling through the night from street to street  through the long night until the silver break of day the little gray feet know no rest through the lone night until the last snowflake has dropped from heaven upon the earths white breast the dusky halfclad girls of tired feet are trudging thinly shod from street to street  ah stern harsh world that in the wretched way of poverty dishonor and disgrace has pushed the timid little feet of clay the sacred brown feet of my fallen race ah heart of me the weary weary feet in harlem wandering from street to street
