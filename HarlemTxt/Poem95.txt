i am a reaper whose muscles set at sundown all my oats are cradled but i am too chilled and too fatigued to bind them and i hunger  i crack a grain between my teeth i do not taste it i have been in the fields all day my throat is dry i hunger  my eyes are caked with dust of oatfields at harvesttime i am a blind man who stares across the hills seeking stackd fields of other harvesters  it would be good to see them    crookd split and ironringd handles of the scythes    it would be good to see them dustcaked and blind i hunger  dusk is a strange feard sheath their blades are dulld in my throat is dry and should i call a cracked grain like the oats    eoho  i fear to call what should they hear me and offer me their grain oats or wheat or corn i have been in the fields all day i fear i could not taste it i fear knowledge of my hunger  my ears are caked with dust of oatfields at harvesttime i am a deaf man who strains to hear the calls of other harvesters whose throats are also dry  it would be good to hear their songs    reapers of the sweetstalked cane cutters of the corn    even though their throats cracked and the strangeness of their voices deafened me  i hunger my throat is dry now that the sun has set and i am chilled i fear to call eoho my brothers  i am a reaper eoho all my oats are cradled but i am too fatigued to bind them and i hunger i crack a grain it has no taste to it my throat is dry     o my brothers i beat my palms still soft against the stubble of my harvesting you beat your soft palms too my pain is sweet sweeter than the oats or wheat or corn it will not bring me knowledge of my hunger
