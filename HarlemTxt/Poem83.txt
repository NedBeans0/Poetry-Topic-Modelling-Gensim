of course you have faced the dilemma it is announced they all smirk and rise if they are ultra they remove their hats and look ecstatic then they look at you what shall you donoblesse oblige you cannot be boorish or ungracious and too after all it is your country and you do love its ideals if not all of its realities now then i have thought of a way out arise gracefully remove your hat and tilt your head then sing as follows powerfully and with deep unction theyll hardly note the little changes and their feelings and your conscience will thus be saved  my country tis of thee late land of slavery of thee i sing land where my fathers pride slept where my mother died from every mountain side let freedom ring  my native country thee land of the slave set free thy fame i love i love thy rocks and rills and oer thy hate which chills my heart with purpose thrills to rise above  let laments swell the breeze and wring from all the trees sweet freedoms song let laggard tongues awake let all who hear partake let southern silence quake the sound prolong  our fathers god to thee author of liberty to thee we sing soon may our land be bright with freedoms happy light protect us by thy might great god our king
