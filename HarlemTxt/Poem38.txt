i  time unhinged the gates of plymouth rock and jamestown and ellis island and worlds of men with hungers of body and soul hazarded the wilderness of waters cadenced their destinies with the potterswheeling miracles of mountain and valley prairie and river  these were the men who bridged the ocean with arches of dreams and piers of devotion  messiahs from the sodoms and gomorrahs of the old world searchers for cathay and cipango and el dorado mystics from oubangui chari and uppsala serfs from perugia and tonle sap jailbirds from newgate and danzig patriots from yokosuka and stralsund scholars from oxford and leyden beggars from bagdad and montmartre traders from the tyrrhenian sea and mona passage sailors from the skagerrak and bosporus strait iconoclasts from buteshire and zermatt  ii  these were the men of many breeds who mixed their bloods and sowed their seeds designed in gold and shaped of dross they raised the sword beside the cross  these were the men who laughed at odds and scoffed at dooms and diced with gods who freed their souls from inner bars and mused with forests and sang with stars  these were the men of prose and rhyme who telescoped empires of time who knew the feel of spinal verve and walked the straight line of the curve  these were the men of iron lips who challenged dawns apocalypse who married earth and sea and sky and died to live and lived to die  these were the men who dared to be the sires of things they could not see whose martyred and  rejected bones became the states foundationstones  iii  into the arteries of the republic poured the babels of bloods the omegas of peoples the moods of continents the meltingpots of seas the flotsams of isms the flavors of tongues the yesterdays of martyrs the tomorrows of utopias  into the matrix of the republic poured white gulf streams of europe black tidal waves of africa yellow neap tides of asia niagaras of the little people  america america is the black mans country the red mans the yellow mans the brown mans the white mans  america an international river with a legion of tributaries a magnificent cosmorama with myriad patterns and colors a giant forest with loinroots in a hundred lands a cosmopolitan orchestra with a thousand instruments playing america  iv  i see america in daniel boone as he scouts in the judas night of a forest aisle in big paul bunyan as he guillotines the timber avalanche that writhes a mile  i see america in jesse james as his legends match his horses epic stride in big john henry as his hammer beats the monster shovel that quakes the mountainside  i see america in casey jones as he mounts no 4 with the seal of death in his hand in johnny appleseed as his miracles fruit the hills and valleys and plains of our promised land  i see america in joe dimaggio as his bat cuts a vacuum in the paralyzed air in brown joe louis surfed in white acclaim as he fights his countrys cause in madison square  i see america in thomas paine as he pinnacles the freedoms that tyrants ban in young abe lincoln tanned by prairie suns as he splits his rails and thinks the rights of man  v  a blind man said look at the kikes and i saw rosenwald sowing the seeds of culture in the black belt michelson measuring the odysseys of invisible worlds brandeis opening the eyes of the blind to the constitution boas translating the oneness in the rosetta stone of mankind  a blind man said look at the dagos and i saw la guardia shaping the cosmos of pyramided manhattan brumidi verving the capitol frescoes of washington at yorktown caruso scaling the alpine ranges of drama with the staff of song toscanini enchanting earthward the music of the spheres  a blind man said look at the chinks and i saw lin yutang crying the world charter in the white mans wilderness dr chen charting the voyages of bacteria in the lilly laboratories lu cong weaving planttapestries in the department of agriculture madame chiang kaishek interpreting the orient and the occident  a blind man said look at the bohunks and i saw sikorsky blueprinting the cabala of the airways stokowski imprisoning the magic of symphonies with a baton zvak erecting st patrickss cathedral in a forest of skyscrapers dvořák enwombing the multiple soul of the new world  a blind man said look at the niggers and i saw black samson mowing down hessians with a scythe at brandywine marian anderson bewitching continents with the talisman of art fred douglass hurling from tombstones the philippies of freedom private brooks dying at the feet of macarthur in bataan  vi  america can sing a lullaby when slippered dusk steals down the terraced sky then in a voice to wake the plymouth dead embattled hordes of tyranny defy  america can join the riotous throng and sell her virtues for a harlot song then give the clothes that hide her nakedness to help her sister nations carry on  america can worship gods of brass and bow before the strut of breed and class then gather to her bosom refugees who champion the causes of the mass  america can loose a world of laughter to shake the states from cornerstone to rafter then gird her mighty loins with corded strength in the volcanic nightmare of disaster  america can knot her arms and brow and guide across frontiers the untamed plow then beat the plowshares into vengeful swords to keep a rendezvous with justice now  vii sometimes uncle sam pillows his head on the statue of liberty tranquilizes himself on the soft couch of the corn belt laves his feet in the golden gate and sinks into the nepenthe of slumber  and the termites of antisemitism busy themselves and the ku klux klan marches with rope and faggot and the moneychangers plunder the temple of democracy and the copperheads start boring from within and the robber barons pillage the countryside and the con men try to jimmy the constitution and the men of good will are hounded over the land and the people groan in the tribulum of tryanny  then comes the roar of cannon at fort sumter or the explosion of teapot dome or the wall street crash of 29 or the thunderclap of bombs at pearl harbor  viii  i have a rendezvous with america at plymouth rock where the mayflower lies battered beam on beam by titanchested waves that heave and shock  and cold december winds that in the riggings pound their fists and scream here now the pilgrim fathers draw the new worlds testament of faith and law a government of and by and for the people a pact of peers who share and bear and plan a government which leaves men free and equal and yet knits men together as one man  i have a rendezvous with america at valley forge these are the times that try mens souls and fetter cowards to their under goals through yonder gorge hunger and cold disease and fear advance with treasonous blows the bayonets of the wind stab through our winter soldiers clothes and bloody footsteps stain the deep december snows here now our winter soldiers keep the faith and keep their powder dry    to do or die  i have a rendezvous with america this seventh of december the maiden freshness of pearl harbors dawn the peace of seas that thieve the breath i shall remember then out of yonder sunrise land of death the fascist spawn strikes like the talons of the mad harpoon strikes like the moccasin in the black lagoon strikes like the fury of the raw typhoon the traitors ruse and the traitors lie pearl harbors ruins of sea and sky shall live with me till the day i die here now at pearl harbor i remember i have a rendezvous at plymouth rock and valley forge this seventh of december  ix  in these midnight dawns of the gethsemanes and the golgothas of peoples i put my ear to the common ground of america from the brows of mountains and the breasts of rivers and the flanks of prairies and the wombs of valleys swells the victory march of the republic in the masculine allegro of factories and the blues rhapsody of express trains in the bass crescendo of power dams and the nocturne adagio of river boats in the sound and fury of threshing machines and the clarineting needles of textile mills in the fortissimo hammers of shipyards and the diatonic picks of coal mines in the oboe rhythms of cotton gins and the sharped notes of salmon traps in the belting harmonics of lumber camps and the drumming derricks of oil fields  x  in these midnight dawns of the vulture philistines of the unquiet skies and the rattlesnake attilas of the uptorn seas  in these midnight dawns of the gethsemanes and the golgothas of peoples america stands granitefooted as the rocky mountains beaten by the whirlpool belts of wet winds deepchested as the appalachians sunning valleys in the palms of their hands toughtendoned as the cumberlands shouldering the truck caravans of us 40 cleanflanked as the lavender walls of palo duro washed by the living airs of canyon rivers eaglehearted as the pacific redwoods uprearing their heads in the dawns and dusks of ages
