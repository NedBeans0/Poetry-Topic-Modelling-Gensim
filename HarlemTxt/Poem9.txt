let america be america again let it be the dream it used to be let it be the pioneer on the plain seeking a home where he himself is free  america never was america to me  let america be the dream the dreamers dreamed let it be that great strong land of love where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme that any man be crushed by one above  it never was america to me  o let my land be a land where liberty is crowned with no false patriotic wreath but opportunity is real and life is free equality is in the air we breathe  theres never been equality for me nor freedom in this homeland of the free  say who are you that mumbles in the dark and who are you that draws your veil across the stars
