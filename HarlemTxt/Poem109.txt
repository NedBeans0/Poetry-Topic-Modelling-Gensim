dedicated to kwame nkrumah i was a little boy at home with strangers i liked my playmates and knew well whence all their parents came from england scotland royal france from germany and oft by chance the humble emerald isle  but my brown skin and closecurled hair was alien and how it grew none knew few tried to say some dropped a wonderful word or stray some laughed and stared  and then it came i dreamed i placed together all i knew all hints and slurs together drew i dreamed  i made one picture of what nothing seemed i shuddered in dumb terror in silence screamed for now it seemed this i had dreamed  how up from hell a land had leaped a wretched land all scorched and seamed covered with ashes chained with pain streaming with blood in horror lain its very air a shriek of death and agony of hurt  anon i woke but in one corner of my soul i stayed asleep forget i could not but never would i remember that hellhoist ghost of slavery and woe  i lived and grew i worked and hoped i planned and wandered gripped and coped with every doubt but one that slept yet clamoured to awaken i became old old worn and gray along my hard and weary way rolled war and pestilence war again i looked on poverty and foul disease i walked with death and yet i knew there stirred a doubt were all dreams true and what in truth was africa  one cloudswept day a seer appeared all closed and veiled as me he hailed and bid me make three journeys to the world seeking all through their lengthened links the endless riddle of the sphinx  i went to moscow ignorance grown wise taught me wisdom i went to peking poverty grown rich showed me the wealth of work i came to accra  here at last i looked back on my dream i heard the voice that loosed the longlooked dungeons of my soul i sensed that africa had come not up from hell but from the sum of heavens glory  i lifted up mine eyes to ghana and swept the hills with high hosanna above the sun my sight took flight till from that pinnacle of light i saw dropped down this earth of crimson green and gold roaring with color drums and song  happy with dreams and deeds worth more than doing around me velvet faces loomed burnt by the kiss of everlasting suns under great stars of midnight glory trees danced and foliage sang  the lilies hallelujah rang where robed with rule on golden stool the goldcrowned priests with duty done pour high libations to the sun and danced to gods  red blood flowed rare neath closeclung hair while subtle perfume filled the air and whirls and whirls of tiny curls crowned heads  yet ghana shows its might and power not in its color nor its flower but in its wondrous breadth of soul its joy of life its selfless role of giving school and clinic home and hall road and garden bloom and call socialism blossoms bold on communism centuries old  i lifted my last voice and cried i cried to heaven as i died o turn me to the golden horde summon all western nations toward the rising sun  from reeking west whose day is done who stink and stagger in their dung toward africa china indias strand where kenya and himalaya stand and nile and yangtze roll turn every yearning face of man  come with us dark america the scum of europe battened here and drowned a dream made fetid swamp a refuge seem  enslaved the black and killed the red and armed the rich to loot the dead worshipped the whores of hollywood where once the virgin mary stood and lynched the christ  awake awake o sleeping world honor the sun  worship the stars those vaster suns who rule the night where black is bright and all unselfish work is right and greed is sin  and africa leads on pan africa
