a residual habit from the veld and stout as a peasant in the breadandcheese war said the lie of the artist is the only lie for which a mortal or a god should die  because nobody was a nobody to him when from his thin charcoal lips irony escaped it was malice toward none the therapy of his slips by design into primitive objets dart humanized the patrons of the harlem gallery as much as the masterworks he salvaged from the lethe of the american way in black manhattan mr guy delaporte iii cried out before the regents mr curator what manner of man is this  unharassed by the ignis fatuus of a lost job doctor nkomo clicked throatily and with a chuckle whispered to me its not this buckle heads right or wrong if he does right or wrong like a humming disk came the strophe of a rebel bantu song  hubris is an evil the greeks euripides sophocles aeschylus boned and fleshed to wear the mask pride is the lust sinewed wench the churchman speaks of first in the table of deadly sins doctor

the feathered rex to a mountain top although it raised the dickens the hunter explained youre not a chicken aquila he launched the ungainly bird into space a fouled umbrella in the wing lock of habit it tumbled in disgrace  down  down  down a ghostified cock  out of the visaing face of the sun swooped the falcon baron clarioning the summons of an aeried race twice the barnyard eagle answered the
