whoever it was who brought the first wood and coal to start the fire did his part well not all wood takes to fire from a match nor coal from wood before its burned to charcoal the wood and coal in question caught a flame and flared up beautifully touching the air that takes a flame from anything  somehow the fire was furnaced and then the time was ripe for some to say right banking of the furnace saves the coal ive seen them set to work each in his way though all with shovels and with ashes never resting till the fire seemed most dead whereupon theyd crawl in hooded nightcaps contentedly to bed sometimes the fire left alone would die but like as not spiced tongues remaining by the hardest on till day would flicker up never strong to anyone who cared to rake for them but roaring fires never have been made that way id like to tell those folks that one grand flare transferred to memory tissues of the air is worth a like or for dull minds that turn in gold all money ever saved by banking coal
