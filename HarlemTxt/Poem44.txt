trade trade versus art brain brain versus heart oh the earthiness of these hardhearted times when clinking dollars and jingling dimes drown all the finer music of the soul  life as an octopus with but this creed that all the world was made to serve his greed trade has spread out his mighty myriad claw and drawn into his foul polluted maw the brightest and the best well nigh has he drained dry the sacred fount of truth and if forsooth he has left yet some struggling streams from it to go he has contaminated so their flow that truth scarce is it true  poor art with struggling gasp lies strangled dying in his mighty grasp he locks his grimy fingers bout her snowy throat so tender is there no power to rescue her protect defend her shall art be left to perish shall all the images her shrines cherish be left to this iconoclast to vulgar trade  oh that mankind had less of brain and more of heart oh that the world had less of trade and more of art then would there be less grinding down the poor then would men learn to love each other more for trade stalks like a giant through the land bearing aloft the rich in his high hand while down beneath his mighty ponderous tread he crushes those who cry for daily bread
