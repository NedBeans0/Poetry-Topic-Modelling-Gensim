a group of young men in jacksonville florida arranged to celebrate lincolns birthday in 1900 my brother j rosamond johnson and i decided to write a song to be sung at the exercises i wrote the words and he wrote the music our new york publisher edward b marks made mimeographed copies for us and the song was taught to and sung by a chorus of five hundred colored school children shortly afterwards my brother and i moved away from jacksonville to new york and the song passed out of our minds but the school children of jacksonville kept singing it they went off to other schools and sang it they became teachers and taught it to other children within twenty years it was being sung over the south and in some other parts of the country today the song popularly known as the negro national hymn is quite generally used the lines of this song repay me in an elation almost of exquisite anguish whenever i hear them sung by negro children lift every voice and sing till earth and heaven ring ring with the harmonies of liberty let our rejoicing rise high as the listening skies let it resound loud as the rolling sea sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us facing the rising sun of our new day begun let us march on till victory is won  stony the road we trod bitter the chastening rod felt in the days when hope unborn had died yet with a steady beat have not our weary feet come to the place for which our fathers sighed we have come over a way that with tears has been watered we have come treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered out from the gloomy past till now we stand at last where the white gleam of our bright star is cast  god of our weary years god of our silent tears thou who hast brought us thus far on the way thou who hast by thy might led us into the light keep us forever in the path we pray lest our feet stray from the places our god where we met thee lest our hearts drunk with the wine of the world we forget thee shadowed beneath thy hand may we forever stand true to our god true to our native land
