last night i heard your voice mother the words you sang to me when i a little barefoot boy knelt down against your knee  and tears gushed from my heart mother and passed beyond its wall but though the fountain reached my throat the drops refused to fall  tis ten years since you died mother just ten dark years of pain and oh i only wish that i could weep just once again
