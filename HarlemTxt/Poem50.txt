seems lak to me de stars dont shine so bright seems lak to me de sun done loss his light seems lak to me ders nothin goin right sence you went away  seems lak to me de sky aint half so blue seems lak to me dat eveything wants you seems lak to me i dont know what to do sence you went away  seems lak to me dat eveything is wrong seems lak to me de days jes twice ez long seems lak to me de birds forgot his song sence you went away  seems lak to me i jes cant hep but sigh seems lak to me ma thoat keeps gittin dry seems lak to me a tear stays in ma eye sence you went away
