pour o pour that parting soul in song o pour it in the sawdust glow of night into the velvet pinesmoke air tonight and let the valley carry it along and let the valley carry it along  o land and soil red soil and sweetgum tree so scant of grass so profligate of pines now just before an epochs sun declines thy son in time i have returned to thee thy son i have in time returned to thee  in time for though the sun is setting on a songlit race of slaves it has not set though late o soil it is not too late yet to catch thy plaintive soul leaving soon gone leaving to catch thy plaintive soul soon gone  o negro slaves dark purple ripened plums squeezed and bursting in the pinewood air passing before they stripped the old tree bare one plum was saved for me one seed becomes  an everlasting song a singing tree caroling softly souls of slavery what they were and what they are to me caroling softly souls of slavery
