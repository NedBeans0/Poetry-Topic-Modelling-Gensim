at first youll joy to see the playful snow like white moths trembling on the tropic air or waters of the hills that softly flow gracefully falling down a shining stair  and when the fields and streets are covered white and the windworried void is chilly raw or underneath a spell of heat and light the cheerless frozen spots begin to thaw  like me youll long for home where birds glad song means flowering lanes and leas and spaces dry and tender thoughts and feelings fine and strong beneath a vivid silverflecked blue sky  but oh more than the changeless southern isles when spring has shed upon the earth her charm youll love the northland wreathed in golden smiles by the miraculous sun turned glad and warm
