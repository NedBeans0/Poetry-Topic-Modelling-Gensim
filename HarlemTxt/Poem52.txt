now as i watch you strong of arm and endurance battling and struggling with the waves that rush against you ever with invincible strength returning into my heart grown each day more tranquil and peaceful comes a fierce longing of mind and soul that will not be appeased until like you i breast yon deep and boundless expanse of blue  with an outward stroke of power intense your mighty arm goes forth cleaving its way through waters that rise and roll ever a ceaseless vigil keeping over the treasures beneath  my heart goes out to you of dauntless courage and spirit indomitable and though my lips would speak my spirit forbids me to ask is your heart as true as your arm
