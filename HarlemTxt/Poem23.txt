there is joy in the woods just now the leaves are whispers of song and the birds make mirth on the bough and music the whole day long and god to dwell in the town in these springlike summer days on my brow an unfading frown and hate in my heart always  a machine out of gear aye tired yet forced to go onfor im hired  just forced to go on through fear for every day i must eat and find ugly clothes to wear and bad shoes to hurt my feet and a shelter for workdrugged sleep a mere drudge but what can one do a man thats a man cannot weep suicide a quitter oh no  but a slave should never grow tired whom the masters have kindly hired  but oh for the woods the flowers of natural sweet perfume the heartening summer showers and the smiling shrubs in bloom dustfree dewtinted at morn the fresh and lifegiving air the billowing waves of corn and the birds notes rich and clear  for a manmachine toiltired may crave beauty toothough hes hired
