the sky lazily disdaining to pursue the setting sun too indolent to hold a lengthened tournament for flashing gold passively darkens for nights barbecue  a feast of moon and men and barking hounds an orgy for some genius of the south with bloodhot eyes and canelipped scented mouth surprised in making folksongs from soul sounds  the sawmill blows its whistle buzzsaws stop and silence breaks the bud of knoll and hill soft settling pollen where plowed lands fulfill their early promise of a bumper crop  smoke from the pyramidal sawdust pile curls up blue ghosts of trees tarrying low where only chips and stumps are left to show the solid proof of former domicile  meanwhile the men with vestiges of pomp race memories of king and caravan highpriests an ostrich and a jujuman go singing through the footpaths of the swamp  their voices rise   the pine trees are guitars strumming pineneedles fall like sheets of rain   their voices rise   the chorus of the cane is caroling a vesper to the stars    o singers resinous and soft your songs above the sacred whisper of the pines give virgin lips to cornfield concubines bring dreams of christ to dusky canelipped throngs
