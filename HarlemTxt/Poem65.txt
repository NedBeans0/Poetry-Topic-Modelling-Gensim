my roots are deep in southern life deeper than john brown or nat turner or robert lee i was sired and weaned in a tropic world the palm tree and banana leaf mango and coconut breadfruit and rubber trees know me  warm skies and gulf blue streams are in my blood i belong with the smell of fresh pine with the trail of coon and the spring growth of wild onion  i am no hothouse bulb to be reared in steamheated flats with the music of el and subway in my ears walled in by steel and wood and brick far from the sky  i want the cotton fields tabacco and the cane i want to walk along with sacks of seed to drop in fallow ground restless music is in my heart and i am eager to be gone  o southland sorrow home melody beating in my bone and blood how long will the klan of hate the hounds and the chain gangs keep me from my own
