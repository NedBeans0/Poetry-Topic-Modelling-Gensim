some day when trees have shed their leaves and against the mornings white the shivering birds beneath the eaves have sheltered for the night well turn our faces southward love toward the summer isle where bamboos spire the shafted grove and widemouthed orchids smile  and we will seek the quiet hill where towers the cotton tree and leaps the laughing crystal rill and works the droning bee and we will build a cottage there beside an open glade with blackribbed bluebells blowing near and ferns that never fade
