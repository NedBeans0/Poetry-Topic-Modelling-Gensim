about me young careless feet linger along the garish street above a hundred shouting signs shed down their bright fantastic glow upon the merry crowd and lines of moving carriages below oh wonderful is broadway  only my heart my heart is lonely  desire naked linked with passion goes trutting by in brazen fashion from playhouse cabaret and inn the rainbow lights of broadway blaze all gay without all glad within as in a dream i stand and gaze at broadway shining broadway  only my heart my heart is lonely
