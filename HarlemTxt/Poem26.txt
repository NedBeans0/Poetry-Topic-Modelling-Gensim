i  throughout the afternoon i watched them there snowfairies falling falling from the sky whirling fantastic in the misty air contending fierce for space supremacy and they flew down a mightier force at night as though in heaven there was revolt and riot and they frail things had taken panic flight down to the calm earth seeking peace and quiet i went to bed and rose at early dawn to see them huddled together in a heap each merged into the other upon the lawn worn out by the sharp struggle fast asleep the sun shone brightly on them half the day by night they stealthily had stoln away   ii  and suddenly my thoughts then turned to you who came to me upon a winters night when snowsprites round my attic window flew your hair disheveled eyes aglow with light my heart was like the weather when you came the wanton winds were blowing loud and long but you with joy and passion all aflame you danced and sang a lilting summer song i made room for you in my little bed took covers from the closet fresh and warm a downful pillow for your scented head and lay down with you resting in my arm you went with dawn you left me ere the day the lonely actor of a dreamy play
