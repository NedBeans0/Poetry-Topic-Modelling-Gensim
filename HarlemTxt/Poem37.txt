aunt martha bustles from room to room between attic and basement with duster and broom  like an oven grenade in cobwebby corners her broom explodes a babel of wonders  her summer crusade havocs the bugs like an enfilade she rakes the rugs  the sound and fury of table and bed whirs a panic of sparrows to the oaks overhead  untenable grows the vast of the house for even the ghost of lazarus mouse  the fogies convert back fences to staffs and sow their gossip with pharisee laughs  aunt marthas scowl is a lithographs  as the fogies watch her attic lairs jettison the junk of heirloom wares she shouts old houses need cleaning upstairs
